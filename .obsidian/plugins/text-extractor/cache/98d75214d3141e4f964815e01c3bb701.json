You're correct that W (n) is a function that returns. the number of ways to climb n stairs, iven that you can climb either 1or 2 stairs at atime. Whenwesay W (n) = W (n — 1) + W (n — 2), were saying that the number of waysto climb n stairs s the sumof: 1. The number of ways to climb n — 1 stairs (because we could take a single step from there to reach n), and 2. The number of ways to climb n — 2 stairs (because we could take a double step from there to reach n). So,for example, when . = 6, W (6) = W (5) + W (4). This means that the number of ways to climb 6 stairs is the sum of the number of waysto climb 5 stairs ‘andthe number of ways to climb 4 stairs. The reason this works s because any sequence of steps that gets you o the top of ‘the stairs must end with either a single step or a double step. So, we can \"build\" ‘every possible sequence of steps by taking every sequence that gets us one step from the top and adding a single step, and taking every sequence that gets us two ‘steps from the top and adding a double step. This is why the function V¥ (n) isrelated to the Fibonace sequence: 's built up by ‘adding together the results from the two previous steps, justike n the Fibonacci sequence.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
