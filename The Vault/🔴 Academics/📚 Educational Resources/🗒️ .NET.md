In the below code, why must the function `Main` have the `async Task<int>` attribute prepended to it? 
```cpp
internal abstract class MerriamWebsterAnkiFlashcardsGenerator
{
    private static HttpClient sharedClient = new()
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"),
    };
    private static async Task<int> Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        using HttpResponseMessage response = await sharedClient.GetAsync("todos/3");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();      
        // print the response content to the console
        string responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        Console.WriteLine(responseContent);    
        return 0;
    }

#card 
Asynchronous methods in C# typically return a `Task` or `Task<T>`, and they should be awaited with the `await` keyword.
When you use the `await` keyword on a Task, the method in which the `await` keyword is used must be marked as `async`. This is the signal to the compiler that the method contains an awaited asynchronous operation.
The `Main` method in this case returns a `Task<int>` because it's an async method and has a return type of `int`. If it didn't return a value, it would return `Task`.
^1684962933140

**Question**: What does `Task<int>` signify in the context of an `async` method like `Main` in a C# program? #card 
**Answer**: `Task<int>` is the return type of an asynchronous method that returns an integer. The `Task` represents an ongoing work that will eventually complete and produce a result of the type specified, in this case, an `int`. The `async` keyword allows the `await` keyword to be used in the method, which means the method will be executed asynchronously. The `Main` method returns `Task<int>` to indicate that it's an asynchronous method that will eventually produce an integer result (usually a status code).
^1684966670448

**Question**: Why is the `Main` function in C# programs marked with `async` when using `HttpClient.GetAsync`? #card 
**Answer**: The `Main` function is marked with `async` because `HttpClient.GetAsync` is an asynchronous method, and any method that uses the `await` keyword must be marked as `async`. This lets the compiler know that the method contains an awaited asynchronous operation.
^1684966693232


**Question**: What does `ReadAsStringAsync` do in the context of an `HttpResponseMessage`? #card 
**Answer**: The `ReadAsStringAsync` method is used to asynchronously read the content from the HTTP response as a string. It reads the byte stream from the HTTP response and converts it into a string using the encoding specified in the HTTP response.
^1684966670452

**Question**: What are the benefits of reading the content of an HTTP response asynchronously? #card 
**Answer**: Reading the content asynchronously allows the application to do other work while waiting for the IO operation to complete. It makes the application more efficient and responsive, especially for IO-bound operations.
^1684966693237


**Question**: What is the difference between thread-based operations and IO Completion Port (IOCP)-based operations? #card 
**Answer**: Thread-based operations dedicate a thread for each IO operation, blocking it until the operation completes. This can be inefficient and resource-intensive. IOCP-based operations, on the other hand, use a pool of threads to handle multiple concurrent IO operations, increasing efficiency and performance.
^1684966680738

**Question**: How does .NET implement IOCP-based operations? #card 
**Answer**: While developers don't directly create and manage IOCPs in C#, the .NET Framework's implementation of async/await and Task uses IOCP under the hood on Windows. When these features are used, they automatically leverage IOCP-based operations.
^1684966670456

In .NET how do you ensure the success of a response? #card 
Use the method `EnsureSuccessStatusCode()`. For example‚Ä¶
```csharp
using HttpResponseMessage response = await sharedClient.GetAsync("");
response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
```

In C#, the {`internal`} keyword is an access modifier that makes a member (like a method, property, or class) accessible only within its own assembly. An assembly in .NET is a unit of deployment like a .dll or .exe file.
^1684967287761

If you wanted to allow any code in any assembly to access a specific method, you would make it {`public`} instead. If you wanted to restrict access to only the containing class, you would use {`private`}. If you wanted to allow access from the containing class and any derived classes, you would use {`protected`}.
^1684967287766

What is the default access modifier in C#? #card 
`internal`

What is the importance of `this` in the method argument of the below code? #card 
```csharp
internal static void WriteRequestToConsole(this HttpResponseMessage response)
{
    ...
}
```
The `this` keyword in front of `HttpResponseMessage response` indicates that `WriteRequestToConsole` is an extension method that can be called on instances of `HttpResponseMessage`. So, instead of calling the method like this:
```csharp
HttpResponseMessageExtensions.WriteRequestToConsole(response);
```
You can call it directly on an instance of `HttpResponseMessage`, like this:
```csharp
response.WriteRequestToConsole();
```
The latter is more intuitive and allows for more fluent and readable code, which is one of the main advantages of extension methods.
^1684968163356


**Question**: What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in the argument list of a method in C#? #card 
**Answer**: The `this` keyword in the argument list of a method is used to create an extension method in C#. An extension method is a static method that can be called as if it were an instance method of the extended type. The `this` keyword in front of the first parameter specifies the type the method will operate on. For example, in `WriteRequestToConsole(this HttpResponseMessage response)`, `this` indicates that `WriteRequestToConsole` is an extension method that can be called on instances of `HttpResponseMessage`.
^1684968163362

How would you write an extension method for the class `HttpResponseMessage`? #card 
```c#
ExtensionMethod(this HttpResponseMessage response)
```

In C#, how would you create a global variable for the entire executable and that would be called rom other classes too?
#card 
- In C#, you typically don't create global variables as you might in other programming languages. Instead, you would usually create a public static property in a static class. This property can then be accessed from any other class in your application.
- Here is an example:
```csharp
public static class GlobalVariables
{
    public static string GlobalString { get; set; }
}
```
You can then access this property from any other class in your application, like this:
```csharp
GlobalVariables.GlobalString = "Hello, World!";
// Getting the value
string myString = GlobalVariables.GlobalString;
```
This will effectively give you a "global" variable, in the sense that it's accessible from any part of your application. However, be aware that using such globally accessible data can lead to problems if not managed carefully, such as making the code harder to understand and maintain, and potentially causing issues with concurrency in multi-threaded applications. It's often better to pass data explicitly through method parameters and return values, or use dependency injection to provide dependencies to classes that need them.
^1685640058564

Factoring in that, in .NET, it is considered better to pass data explicitly through method parameter and return values, or use dependency injection to provide dependencies to classes that need them, how should we handle a `HttpClient` instance? #card 
- Generally, a `HttpClient` instance is a good candidate for using a singleton or shared object in your application because of its connection pooling capabilities. In other words, reusing it for the lifetime of your application is recommended as per Microsoft‚Äôs guidelines
- One common
^1685640058573

Can I have an async method in C# return a string? #card 
- Yes, an async method in C# can return a string. However, the method signature would need to return a `Task<string>`, because asynchronous methods need to return a `Task` or `Task<T>`.
- Here's an example of how you can do this:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetStringAsync() {
	await Task.Delay(1000);  // simulate async work with a delay     
	return "Hello, World!"; 
} 
private static async Task Main(string[] args) {     
	string result = await GetStringAsync();     
	Console.WriteLine(result);  // Outputs: Hello, World! 
}
```

What does the method `public async Task GetStringAsync()` return? #card 
It returns nothing.

What does distributed development entail in the context of C#/.NET development? #card 
Distributed development refers to the practice of developing software in a distributed computing environment, where different components of a software system can run on different systems (or servers), potentially across different locations.
Here are a few elements it might entail in the context of C# and .NET development:
1. **Microservices:** One common approach to distributed development is microservices architecture, where each service runs independently but communicates with others. Each service would have its own database and would be loosely coupled with the other services.
2. **Communication Between Services:** Distributed development requires mechanisms for the different services to communicate with each other. This might include using HTTP/REST, gRPC (a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google), or even a message bus such as RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus.
3. **Distributed Databases:** Your application might also interact with databases that are distributed across different locations. You'd need to understand concepts like data replication, sharding, and consistency models.
4. **Containerization and Orchestration:** Tools like Docker are often used to package and distribute the individual components of a distributed system. Orchestration tools like Kubernetes help manage these containers, handling deployment, scaling, and management.
5. **Cloud Computing Platforms:** Distributed systems often run on cloud platforms, like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. Understanding how to develop, deploy, and manage applications on these platforms can be a crucial part of distributed development.
6. **Distributed Tracing and Logging:** In a distributed system, being able to trace a transaction or operation across multiple services becomes critical for debugging and performance monitoring. Tools like Serilog, along with services like Azure Application Insights or AWS X-Ray, can help with this.
7. **Resiliency and Fault Tolerance:** In distributed systems, dealing with failures becomes more complex. You may need to implement patterns like Circuit Breaker, Retry, or Fallback to handle potential issues.
8. **Distributed Caching:** In order to reduce latency and increase performance, distributed caching like Redis might be used.
9. **Concurrency and Synchronization:** Dealing with concurrency and synchronization in a distributed environment can be complex, and might involve using locks, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives, and dealing with issues like race conditions and deadlocks.
Keep in mind that distributed development usually involves a lot more than just knowledge of a programming language like C# and a framework like .NET. It includes understanding distributed system principles, various tools, and technologies.

What does **cron** stand for? #card 
Command Run On

What is **cron** and what is it used for? #card 
- The `cron` command-line utility is a job scheduler on Unix-like operating systems. Users who set up and maintain software environments use cron to schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts), also known as **cron jobs**, to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
- It typically automates system maintenance or administration‚Äîthough its general-purpose nature makes it useful for things like downloading files from the Internet and downloading email at regular intervals.
