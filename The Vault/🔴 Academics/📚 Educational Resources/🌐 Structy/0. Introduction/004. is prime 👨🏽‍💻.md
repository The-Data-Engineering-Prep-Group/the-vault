### 004. is prime 👨🏽‍💻

#### Solution (C++)

What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach #1**: Simple iteration over the container
	1. Remember that an initial base case is that 0, 1, and all negative numbers are *not* prime numbers.
	2. For the general case, iterate from 2 to $\lfloor{\sqrt{ n }}\rfloor$
		1. If `i` is a whole factor, then we know that $n$ is not a prime number.
	- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
		- Time: $O(\sqrt{n})$
		- Space: $O(1)$

What is a prime number?  
#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- A <span class="spoiler">**prime number**</span> (or a <span class="spoiler">**prime**</span>) is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") greater than 1 that is not a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") of two smaller natural numbers.
- A natural number greater than 1 that is not <span class="spoiler">prime</span> is called a [composite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number "Composite number").


What is the most optimal approach to solving this problem?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Iterate from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ to iterate through all potential divisors of the number $n$ that could be a factor proving that $n$ is not a prime number 
- To better visualize, take a look at this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/geometry-beta/2zvelza7ht).


If one divisor of a number is a factor, does that mean its corresponding divisor is a factor also?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Yes, that's correct. If a number 'b' is a divisor of a number 'a', then 'b' is a factor of 'a'. Similarly, the corresponding quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' is also a factor of 'a'.
- For example, consider the number 12. The divisors (or factors) of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. When you divide 12 by 2, you get 6. Here, both 2 and 6 are divisors of 12. Similarly, dividing 12 by 3 gives 4. Both 3 and 4 are also divisors (factors) of 12.
- In general, for any number 'a', if it can be expressed as a product 'b * c', then both 'b' and 'c' are factors (divisors) of 'a'.


What is the solution to this problem?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
#include <cmath>
bool isPrime(int n) {
  // todo
  if(n == 1) {
    return false;
  }
  for(int potentialFactor {2}; potentialFactor <= std::sqrt(n); potentialFactor++) {
    if(n % potentialFactor == 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```


How do I compute the square root of a number in C++?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Include the `<cmath>` library to call the `std::sqrt()` function.


Does C++ have a built-in function to check if a number is prime?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, currently it does not have one.


So always use the  `<cx>` headers if you are writing C++?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Yes. For example, default to using the `<cmath>` header instead of the `<math.h>`


What is something I *always* make a mistake on when solving this problem and **have** to remember when approaching this problem?  
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Must make sure when I looping all potential factors. I set the bounds of that loop from $2$ to *inclusive* $\sqrt{n}$.


##### Attempt #2 (2023-21-07) ⏲️ 00:08:29

What is wrong with the following code?
```cpp
#include <cmath>
// A number is prime if it is divisible by any number except 1 and itself
bool isPrime(int n) {
  // todo
  // Base CAses:
  if(n == 0) {
    return false;
  }
  if(n == 1) {
    return false;
  }
  // Iterate across, and if divisor is cd of n then we know n is not a prime
  for(int i {2}; i <= std::floor(std::sqrt(n)); i++) {
    if(n % i == 0) {
      return false;
    }
  } 
  return true;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```
 #card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
For my general case, I am starting off my iteration for all potential common divisors at **1** which conflicts already with one of our base cases.

for(int i {2}; i <= std::floor(std::sqrt(n)); i++) {
	// ... do stuff ...
}
```

**Front**: What are the properties of an Input Iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Can read from the pointed-to element, move forward to the next element. Support `++iterator`, `iterator++`, `*iterator`, and `==` and `!=` comparison.


**Front**: What are the properties of an Output Iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Can write to the pointed-to element, move forward to the next element. Support `++iterator`, `iterator++`, and `*iterator` (but only on the left side of an assignment).


**Front**: What are the properties of a Forward Iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Combine the features of input and output iterators, can move forward. Support `++iterator`, `iterator++`, `*iterator` (both as lvalue and rvalue), and `==` and `!=` comparison.


**Front**: What are the properties of a Bidirectional Iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Like forward iterators, but can also move backward. Support `--iterator`, and `iterator--`.


**Front**: What are the properties of a Random Access Iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Provide full-fledged pointer arithmetic. Support iterator addition and subtraction, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` comparisons, `iterator + n`, `iterator - n`, `iterator - iterator`, and `iterator[n]`.


**Front**: What are the properties of a Contiguous Iterator in C++ (since C++20)?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Random access iterators that also guarantee that the underlying sequences are contiguous in memory. Support the `std::to_address` function.


**Front**: What are common properties that all iterators must satisfy in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Assignment, copy construction, and destruction should never invalidate the iterator. Copying or assigning an iterator should not invalidate the source or target iterator.


**Front**: What type of iterators do different containers like `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::forward_list`, `std::set`, and `std::map` provide in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: 
- `std::vector` provides random access iterators
- `std::list` provides bidirectional iterators
- `std::forward_list` provides forward iterators
- `std::set` and `std::map` provide bidirectional iterators


**Front**: How can inserting elements into a container invalidate iterators in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Inserting elements might cause reallocation (e.g., in `std::vector`), changing the memory locations of the elements and invalidating iterators pointing to old locations.


**Front**: How can removing elements from a container invalidate iterators in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Removing elements invalidates iterators that point to the removed elements, and possibly others depending on the container and operation.


**Front**: How can reallocation in a container like `std::vector` invalidate iterators in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Reallocation might occur when a container grows, invalidating all iterators, pointers, and references to elements in the container.


**Front**: How can changing a key in associative containers like `std::set` or `std::map` invalidate iterators in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Modifying a key in a way that affects the ordering will invalidate the iterator.


**Front**: How can calling non-const member functions on a container invalidate iterators in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: Some non-const member functions might invalidate iterators depending on the specific container and the operation performed.



**Front**: What does it mean to invalidate an iterator in C++?
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
**Back**: An iterator is invalidated when it no longer refers to a valid element, making its use undefined behavior. This can occur due to operations such as insertions, deletions, reallocation, etc.
