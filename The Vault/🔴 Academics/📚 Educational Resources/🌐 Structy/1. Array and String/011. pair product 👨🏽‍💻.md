### **011. pair product 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem?
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach #1**:
	1. First iterate across the vector, and insert the elements into a map. 
		1. Check if the complement for the target is already found in the map, and if so, return the the current element position alongside the complement position which should be in the map already.
	- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-18-08) ⏲️ 00:25:00**

What is the return type of `std::distance()`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Should just be an `int`, but when using it in `std::array<int>{}`, need to `static_cast<int>()` the return type of `std::distance()`.

Is the following snippet of code valid? 
```cpp
if(numMap.find(*it) != numMap.end()) {
	numMap[*it] = static_cast<int>( std::distance(numbers.begin(), it) );
}
```

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Yes, the following code snippet is valid, but *logically* wrong.
- If your **intention** is to insert `*it` if it is not currently in `numMap` then you want to change your condition in your `if` statement to…
```cpp
if(numMap.find(*it) == numMap.end) { // <- Means *it not found in numMap
// ...
}
```
