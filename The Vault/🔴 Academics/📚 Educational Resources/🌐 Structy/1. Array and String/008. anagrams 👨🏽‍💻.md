### **008. anagrams 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem? 
#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
❗To be filled.

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-22-07) ⏲️ 00:24:43**

When an element, that does not previously exist in a `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` container, is inserted, what value does the expression return? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ] = s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ] + 1;
```
The expression, on the right side, `s1Map[ *(it1 + i) ]`, returns 0 if `*(it + i)` did not previously exist in the container.

What library is `std::unordered_map` from? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
It is from the library `<unordered_map>`. 
^1690091210788

Is `std::ordered_map` from the library `<unordered_map>`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, it is from the library `<unordered_map>`.

##### **Attempt #2 (2023-31-07) ⏲️ 28:05:07**

First and foremost, must anagrams have the same number of occurrences? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Yes!!!

What is the definition of an anagram? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Containers that have the same elements and the same number of occurrences of those elements. 
^1690838907906

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
map2[*it2] = map2[*it2]++;
```

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Yes, but now how you intend it to be.  In the above case, you are essentially calling the post increment, so essentially you are just having `map2[*it2]` be incremented, but then having it be assigned to its previously self so it is essentially overwriting the increment. If you wish to increment an element in a container, just do the following…
```cpp
map2[*it2]++;
```
