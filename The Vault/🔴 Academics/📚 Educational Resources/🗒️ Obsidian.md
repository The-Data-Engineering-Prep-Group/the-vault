How to improve the code quality of a plugin with ESLint? 
<br>
#card
<br>
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
- To use ESLint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
	- `npm install -g eslint`
- To use ESLint to analyze this project use this command:
    - `eslint main.ts`
    - ESLint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use ESLint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
    - `eslint .\src\`
