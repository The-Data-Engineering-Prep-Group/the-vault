  {"id":"abrahamsenConfrontingInternationalPolitical2020","abstract":"The rise of radical right-wing leaders, parties, movements, and ideas have transformed not only domestic political landscapes but also the direction and dynamics of international relations. Yet for all their emphasis on nationalist identity, on “America First” and “Taking Back Control,” there is an unmistakable international dimension to contemporary nationalist, populist movements. Yet these movements are also often transnationally linked. We argue that a constitutive part of this globality is the New Right's (NR) own distinctive international political sociology (IPS). Key thinkers of the contemporary NR have, over several decades, theorized and strategically mobilized globalized economic dislocation and cultural resentment, developing a coherent sociological critique of globalization. Drawing on the oft-neglected tradition of elite managerialism, NR ideologues have borrowed freely from Lenin and Schmitt on the power of enmity, as well as from Gramsci and the Frankfurt School on counterhegemonic strategies. Against the temptation to dismiss right-wing ideas as “merely” populist and by implication as lacking in ideological and theoretical foundations, we are faced with the much more challenging task of engaging a position that has already developed its own international political sociology and incorporated it into its political strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrahamsen","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Drolet","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Gheciu","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Narita","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Vucetic","given":"Srdjan"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"abrahamsenConfrontingInternationalPolitical2020","container-title":"International Political Sociology","container-title-short":"International Political Sociology","DOI":"10.1093/ips/olaa001","ISSN":"1749-5679","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,1]]},"page":"94-107","title":"Confronting the International Political Sociology of the New Right","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ips/olaa001","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"billCounterElitePopulismCivil2022","abstract":"This article shows how Poland?s ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), is attempting to apply its general strategy of ?elite replacement? in a modified way to civil society. Since independent civil society organizations are not subject to arbitrary state control of appointments (unlike public institutions), this strategy has required a more complex dual approach of pressure and promotion. Organizations perceived as hostile to the party and its values have been subject to the withdrawal of state support and smear campaigns. By contrast, organizations that are politically or ideologically linked to the party have found support in the form of new public funds and other institutional assistance. This article examines the practical functioning and consequences of these processes through two main examples: (1) a state-sponsored campaign against one of Poland?s largest independent charity organizations, the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity and (2) the funding of multiple right-wing NGOs friendly to PiS by the newly established National Freedom Institute. The article shows how PiS?s dual strategy in civil society reinforces its political narratives through support of the broader right-wing cultural narratives that underpin them. At the same time, it demonstrates how funding of friendly organizations directly strengthens party structures by fostering the development of new political and administrative cadres. By analysing PiS?s specific methods of pressure and promotion in the sphere of civil society, the article shows the intertwining of political and cultural narratives and goals within a right-wing populist framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bill","given":"Stanley"}],"citation-key":"billCounterElitePopulismCivil2022","container-title":"East European Politics and Societies","DOI":"10.1177/0888325420950800","ISSN":"0888-3254","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"page":"118-140","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","title":"Counter-Elite Populism and Civil Society in Poland: PiS’s Strategies of Elite Replacement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0888325420950800","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"droletCritiqueReactionNew2022","abstract":"Across the globe, radical conservative political forces and ideas are influencing and even transforming the landscape of international politics. Yet IR is remarkably ill-equipped to understand and engage these new challenges. Unlike political theory or domestic political analyses, conservatism has no distinctive place in the fields? defining alternatives of realism, liberalism, Marxism, and constructivism. This paper seeks to provide a point of entry for such engagement by bringing together what may seem the most unlikely of partners: critical theory and the New Right. Important parts of today?s New Right represent self-conscious appropriations of Critical themes and thinkers?turning them to self-declared ?reactionary? ends. Developing outside the confines of the academy, these forms of thought have woven insights from across Critical theory into new and mobilizing forms of conservative ideology, seeking to link that ideology to social forces that play increasingly active roles in global politics. Our intention here is not to somehow blame Critical perspectives for the ideas of the New Right, either directly or by association. Rather, we seek to show how an engagement with Critical theory helps us understand the New Right, while also demonstrating some of the direct challenges the New Right poses for critical perspectives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Drolet","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Michael C"}],"citation-key":"droletCritiqueReactionNew2022","container-title":"Journal of International Political Theory","DOI":"10.1177/17550882211020409","ISSN":"1755-0882","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"page":"23-45","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"From critique to reaction: The new right, critical theory and international relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/17550882211020409","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"newtonNewtonPapersPhilosophiae1632","abstract":"A copy of the first edition of the Principia that Newton annotated in the margin and on interleaved sheets with his own amendments. The project of amending the first edition of the Principia began quite early. During the 1690s, Newton seemed set on the production of a new edition of the Principia, yet despite the efforts of Nicolas Fatio de Duillier and David Gregory, it appeared that the second edition of the Principia was running into the sand. It seems that material concerns, as much as anything else, finally brought a second edition of the Principia to the press. Richard Bentley, who had been one of the first serious expositors of the Principia in the early 1690s, noticed that copies of the work were becoming increasing hard to find and fetched a high price. In the mid-1690s, Bentley had been instrumental in the establishment of the University Press in Cambridge under the direction of the Vice-Chancellor. Despite its considerable scholarly achievements, the new Press was not a financial success and Bentley and his collaborators remained on the lookout for suitable books that might turn a small profit. A second edition of the Principia appeared to be one of these. In 1708, Bentley persuaded Newton to allow him to prepare a specimen for this publication at the Cambridge University Press. Bentley had already managed to talk Newton into allowing William Whiston to edit and print a manuscript of his lectures on algebra, supposedly delivered in the 1670s and early 1680s [Dd.9.68]. He was now able to offer Newton freedom from the concerns that perhaps most bothered him about a new edition of his most important work: the trouble of finding suitable printers and the cost in terms of time of correcting and seeing the book through the press. Bentley was well aware of the difficulty that English compositors had in setting complex Latin texts and of the extra demands that this might impose on the author. At first, he proposed to look after the production of the Principia himself, but as its demands became more complicated he abandoned the work. Bentley recommended, however, that Roger Cotes, the young Plumian Professor of astronomy in Cambridge, supervise the edition for Newton. The result was a collaboration that substantially improved the text of the Principia, despite the delays that were introduced by the realisation that several parts of Book II and Book III in particular needed further consideration. Indeed, Section VII, Book II, was almost entirely rewritten, as well as the opening of Book III. The cooperation between Newton and Cotes can be followed by reading their correspondence which is in part available at Cotes correspondence. Adv.b.39.1, together with other sources such as the annotated copy of the Principia from Newton’s Library (Trinity College, shelfmark NQ.16.200) and the Liber Secundus Add. 3990, allows scholars to obtain important information about Newton’s protracted reworking of the first edition. For example, at the start of Book 3 [p. 402], Newton had defined a number of ‘Hypotheses’ governing his approach to natural phenomenon. In revising the Principia, he developed these hypotheses into a set of rules: ‘Hypotheses’ was firmly crossed through and replaced with ‘Regulæ philosophandi’ (‘Rules of philosophising’). The book was severely damaged by fire and damp [pp. 347 ff.] some time before it was given to the Library in 1872 as part of the Portsmouth collection. A BBC Radio 4 'In Our Time' discussion of Newton's laws of motion can be listened to here Niccolò Guicciardini, Università degli Studi di Milano, and Scott Mandelbrote, Peterhouse, Cambridge.

  {"id":"rothIntroductionContemporaryCounterMovements2018","abstract":"Brexit and the election of President Trump in the United States are the result of the rise of far-right populist movements which can be observed in Europe, North America, and other regions of the world. Whereas populism itself is one response to neoliberalism, globalization, and austerity measures, the election of Trump, in particular, has caused a new wave of protest. To a far lesser extent, on the 60th anniversary of the founding of the European Union in March 2017, people in the UK and many European countries participated in a March for Europe. These demonstrations represent counter-movements to the growing presence of right-wing, anti-immigrant, racist, nationalist, sexist, homophobic, anti-semitic and anti-Muslim movements throughout Europe and the United States. This rapid response issue surveys right-wing populist and left-liberal counter-movements which represent different responses to neoliberalism, globalization, austerity, and to each other. Social movements reflect and contribute to social change and need to be understood from an intersectional perspective.

This study proposes an alternative framework for FRP emergence by applying a more active ? social movement ? theory, namely the political process model. The political process model consists of three distinct dimensions that can individually affect FRP emergence. Together, they serve as necessary, but also sufficient, conditions for FRP emergence. First, political opportunities refer to dynamic factors outside the FRP that can provide a favourable (institutional) environment for emergence. Second, resource mobilisation refers to more structural factors through which people can mobilise and engage in collective action. Third, a situationally adjusted master frame includes cognitive and cultural factors that allow FRPs to attract both electoral and financial support. While the model is not without its criticisms, this study argues it provides a much-needed complement to more structural and variable-oriented theories of FRP emergence.","author":[{"family":"Van Hauwaert","given":"Steven M."}],"citation-key":"vanhauwaertThinkingOutsideBox2021","container-title":"Journal of Contemporary European Studies","container-title-short":"Journal of Contemporary European Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14782804.2020.1816161","ISSN":"1478-2804","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,2]]},"page":"84-98","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Thinking outside the box: the political process model and far right party emergence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14782804.2020.1816161","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"zhuravskayaPoliticalEffectsInternet2020","abstract":"How do the Internet and social media affect political outcomes? We review empirical evidence from the recent political economy literature, focusing primarily on work that considers traits that distinguish the Internet and social media from traditional off-line media, such as low barriers to entry and reliance on user-generated content. We discuss the main results about the effects of the Internet in general, and social media in particular, on voting, street protests, attitudes toward government, political polarization, xenophobia, and politicians? behavior. We also review evidence on the role of social media in the dissemination of fake news, and we summarize results about the strategies employed by autocratic regimes to censor the Internet and to use social media for surveillance and propaganda. We conclude by highlighting open questions about how the Internet and social media shape politics in democracies and autocracies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhuravskaya","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Petrova","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Enikolopov","given":"Ruben"}],"citation-key":"zhuravskayaPoliticalEffectsInternet2020","container-title":"Annual Review of Economics","container-title-short":"Annu.
