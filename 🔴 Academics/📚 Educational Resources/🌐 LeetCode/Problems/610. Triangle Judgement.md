###### Notes

﹇<br>
What properties must _shapes_ satisfy in order to be considered a _triangle_?

#card 

1. It must have exactly three straight sides.
2. It must have exactly three angles.
3. The sum of the interior angles must equal 180 degrees.
4. Each side must be a line segment, not a curve.
5. The sides must be closed to form a polygon.
6. The shape must be two-dimensional.
7. The sides must not be collinear, meaning they cannot lie on the same straight line.

﹇<br>
What must be true for all side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ of a triangle?

#card

All side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be greater than zero $(a > 0)$, $(b > 0)$, $(c > 0)$.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>

﹇<br>
What is the Triangle Inequality Theorem?

#card

This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side $(a + b > c)$, $(a + c > b)$, $(b + c > a)$.

﹇<br>
How can you determine if a shape with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is a valid triangle?

#card

All side lengths must be greater than zero $(a > 0)$, $(b > 0)$, $(c > 0)$ and the Triangle Inequality Theorem must hold $(a + b > c)$, $(a + c > b)$, $(b + c > a)$.

﹇<br>
Can you use a `CASE` statement to create a derived column in the `SELECT` clause of an `SQL` query?

#card 

Yes, you can use a `CASE` statement in the` SELECT` clause to create a derived column based on some conditions. The `CASE` statement will evaluate the condition for each row and assign the respective value in the derived column.

﹇<br>
What is the purpose of using a `CASE` statement in the `SELECT` clause? 

#card 

The purpose of using a `CASE` statement in the `SELECT` clause is to create a derived column that doesn't exist in the table. The derived column is computed on-the-fly based on the conditions specified in the `CASE` statement.
