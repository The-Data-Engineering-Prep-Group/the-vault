## Project Structure

﹇<br>
What are the benefits and downside to putting the _solution_ and _project_ in the **same** directory? (This is in the context of creating a project in Visual Studio)


#card 

There are both benefits and downsides to putting the solution and project in the same directory when creating a project in Visual Studio<sup>[\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42568331/is-it-a-bad-idea-for-my-solution-and-project-to-be-stored-in-separate-locations)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8678251/what-are-the-benefits-of-multiple-projects-and-one-solution)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-visual-studio/0596003609/ch01.html)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](https://tipsfolder.com/i-place-solution-project-same-directory-fb048ce4c1a3edfd94c510e62a15c409/)</sup>.

**Benefits**:

- **Simplicity**: The simplest way to create a new project in Visual Studio is to create a new project—by default, Visual Studio will create a new solution with the same name as the project, placing the solution files in the same directory as the project<sup>[\[3\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-visual-studio/0596003609/ch01.html)</sup>. This works fine for small projects<sup>[\[3\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-visual-studio/0596003609/ch01.html)</sup>.
- **Organization**: It can make sense to have a directory structure that includes your solution file and subdirectories for each individual project when it comes to multi-project solutions<sup>[\[4\]](https://tipsfolder.com/i-place-solution-project-same-directory-fb048ce4c1a3edfd94c510e62a15c409/)</sup>.

**Downsides**:

- **Not Suited for Complex Applications**: Although this works fine for small projects, it isn’t well suited to more complex applications<sup>[\[3\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-visual-studio/0596003609/ch01.html)</sup>.
- **Source Control Issues**: Once you get into Source Control, whether it’s TFS or GIT, then it will matter - they (projects in a solution) have to be in the same parent folder to be handled easily<sup>[\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42568331/is-it-a-bad-idea-for-my-solution-and-project-to-be-stored-in-separate-locations)</sup>.
- **Poor Dependency Management**: Fewer packages can result in poor dependency management<sup>[\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8678251/what-are-the-benefits-of-multiple-projects-and-one-solution)</sup>.

In conclusion, whether you should keep both the solution and the project in the same directory depends on the complexity of your application and your specific needs<sup>[\[1\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42568331/is-it-a-bad-idea-for-my-solution-and-project-to-be-stored-in-separate-locations)</sup><sup>[\[2\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8678251/what-are-the-benefits-of-multiple-projects-and-one-solution)</sup><sup>[\[3\]](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-visual-studio/0596003609/ch01.html)</sup><sup>[\[4\]](https://tipsfolder.com/i-place-solution-project-same-directory-fb048ce4c1a3edfd94c510e62a15c409/)</sup>.
