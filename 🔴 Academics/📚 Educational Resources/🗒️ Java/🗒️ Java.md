## 🗒️ Java

On Window machines, what does `%JAVA_HOME%` mean in the segment `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`? Specifically, I am referring to the context of environment variables.
#card 
In the context of `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`, the `%JAVA_HOME%` part is a placeholder for the value of the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable in Windows.

When configuring my environment variables, how should I configure it to support Java?
#card 
- Configure `$env:JAVA_HOME` to point to the `java`, _not_ `java/bin`, folder.
- Configure`$env:PATH` to include `%JAVA_HOME%/bin`.
