What are some potential ['cmake clean' commands to clear up CMake output](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9680420/looking-for-a-cmake-clean-command-to-clear-up-cmake-output)?

#card

For CMake 3.X
- CMake 3.X offers a 'clean' target:
```cmake
cmake --build C:/foo/build/ --target clean
```
- From the CMake docs for 3.0.2:
```cmake
--clean-first  = Build target 'clean' first, then build.
                 (To clean only, use --target 'clean'.)
```
