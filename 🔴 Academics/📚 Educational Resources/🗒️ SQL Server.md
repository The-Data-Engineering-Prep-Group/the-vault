## 🗒️ SQL Server


How do you check, via the terminal that Microsoft’s SQL Server is installed?
#card 
Run the following command…
```cmd
sqlcmd -L
```

What does the following command do?
```cmd
sqlcmd -L
```
#card-reverse 
List all the available SQL Server instances.

What is the difference between the Express and the Developer versions of SQL Server?
#card 
- SQL Server Express and SQL Server Developer are two different editions of Microsoft SQL Server. Both editions are free, but they have some key differences in terms of features and usage.
- [SQL Server Express is an entry-level database that is ideal for learning and building data-driven desktop and small server applications](https://tipsfolder.com/difference-between-sql-server-developer-express-edition-431738195a02415ae897a5ab4393ae0d/)[1](https://tipsfolder.com/difference-between-sql-server-developer-express-edition-431738195a02415ae897a5ab4393ae0d/). [It has a limited set of features and is designed to be easy to use, with a low total cost of ownership](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16).
- [On the other hand, SQL Server Developer edition lets developers build any kind of application on top of SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16). [It includes all the functionality of the Enterprise edition, but is licensed for use as a development and test system, not as a production server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16)[2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2022?view=sql-server-ver16). [SQL Server Developer is an ideal choice for people who build and test applications](about:blank#)[1](https://tipsfolder.com/difference-between-sql-server-developer-express-edition-431738195a02415ae897a5ab4393ae0d/).
- In summary, if you are a developer building and testing applications, SQL Server Developer edition would be the better choice as it provides access to all the features of SQL Server. If you are learning about databases or building small data-driven applications, SQL Server Express might be a good fit for you.
