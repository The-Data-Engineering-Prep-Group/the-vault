#### Solution (C++)

﹇<br>
What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- **Approach #1**: Using the `max_element()` function
	1. Just use the `std::max_element()`!
	- **Computational Complexity**:
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- **Approach #2**: Using pointers
	1. Create a variable called `maxValue` that will be initially set to the `numeric_limits<int>::max()`.
	2. Iterate across the container.
		1. If the current `maxValue` is less than the current value, set `maxValue` to that value.
	- **Asymptotic Analysis**:
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

In C++, how can you represent negative or positive infinity?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- One can use the <span class="spoiler">`limits`</span> library, which is part of the C++ Standard library.
- With that, you can use the function `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` to call postive infinity of the type `int`. 
- If you wanted to negative infinity, you can simply do `-numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` to call negative infinity of the type `int`.

What is the downside of using `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` than just using `numeric_limits<int>::double()`?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- `std::numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` return the representation of positive, **if available**. 
- However, `std::numeric_limits<int>::has_inifinity` returns `false` for `int`, meaning that `std::numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` does not return any meaningful value to compare with.

﹇<br>
How can I check the if a data type supports infinity?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Use the `std::numeric_limits<int>::has_inifinity` to check if the value returned from that expression is `true` or `false`.

When trying to assign the value *negative* infinity (of type `int`) via the `<limits>` library, where should one place the negative sign?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

`-numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` Note that the negative sign is placed *before* the whole expression.

What does the `::` mean in the expression `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()`?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- In C++ programming language, the `::` is called the **scope resolution operator**. 
- It is used to specify the scope of a function or variable. 
	- In this case, `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` means that the `infinity()` function is being called from the `numeric_limits` class template specialized for the `int` type.

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- Return the minimum positive normalized value.
- Note, how this is different from when the data type is `int`.

In C++, what is the difference between iterator based loops vs range-`for` loop? 

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- First and foremost, use range-`for` loops.
- A range-`for` loop uses iterators internally. The loop variable is the *dereferenced value*, not the iterator itself.

In C++, does a range-`for` loop expose access to its internal iterators?  

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

A range-`for` loop does *not* expose access to its internal iterators.

What are **containers** in C++?  

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- In C++, containers are data structures that store and organize a collection of objects in memory.
- They are parts of the C++ Standard Library and provide a convenient way to manage collections of data, offering different trade-offs in terms of…
	- performance
	- memory usage
	- functionality

What are sequence containers?  

#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

- Store elements in a linear sequence, where each element has a specific position.
- Examples include…
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::vector`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A dynamic array that automatically resizes itself whenits capacity is exceeded. It provides fast random access and efficient insertions/deletion at the end, but inertions/deletions in the middle can be slow.</span> 
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::list`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A doubly-linked list that allows for fast insertinos and deletions at any position, but does not support random access.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::deque`:</span> <span class="spoiler">A double-ended queue that supports fast random access and efficient insertions/deletions at both the beginning and the end.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::forward_list` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A singly-linked list that allows for fast insertions and deletions at any position, but does not support random access or bidirectional traversal.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::array` (sineC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A fixed-size array with a compile-time size, providing fast random access and a small memory footprint.</span>

What are associative and unordered associative containers?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

- These containers store elements in a sorted or hashed manner, which allows for faster access, insertion, and deletion based on specific keys.
- Examples include…
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::set`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of unique elements, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::multiset`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::map`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of key-value pairs, with unique keys, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::multimap`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::map`, but allows multiple key-value pairs with the same key.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::unordered_set` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A hashed collection of unique elements, providing average constant-time access, insertion, and deletion.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std::unordered_multiset` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std::unordered_set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>

What are some key benefits of containers in C++?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 

- These containers provide various iterator types that allow you to traverse and manipulate the elements in a uniform manner.
- Additionally, they are designed to worth withC++ standard library algorithms, which makes it easy to perform common operations such as…
	- <span class="spoiler">searching elements</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">sorting elements</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">transforming elements</span>

In C++, what is an input iterator?

#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- A type of iterator that allows you to traverse a container in a read-only, forward direction.
	- It is the most basic iterator category in theC++ Standard Library
	- Provides the minimum functionality required for single-pass algorithms, like reading elements from an input stream, or iterating through elements of a container in a linear fashion.

First and foremost, what exactly is an `input_iterator`?

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- To provide more context, an input iterator is a type of iterator that is part of a collection/new way of organizing iterators called “[Iterator concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator).”
	- While, I am still unsure about what the difference is between an `input_iterator` and a `output_iterator`, we need not concern ourselves for now.
