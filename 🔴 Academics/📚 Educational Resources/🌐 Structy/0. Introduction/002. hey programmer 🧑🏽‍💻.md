In C++, what is a **string literal**?

#card-reverse #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
Also, known as an anonymous string, is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code.

Is essentially text between double quotes
- For example: `"Hey World"`

﹇<br>
Should I use `strcat()`?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

No, `strcat()` is considered unsafe. 

This is because there is nothing to stop you from `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence buffer, with undefined results up to and including…

- heap corruption
- stack corruption
- program exit
- even somebody owning your machine if the data past the 100th byte is appropriately constructed.
	- This is a common class of security vulnerability called a buffer overflow

To avoid this, use `std::string`’s operator+

﹇<br>
What is a **buffer overflow**?

#card-reverse #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

When you input more data that the buffer allows. For example, consider `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence. As a result, the remaining input data *“overflows”* to the rest of your memory.

<br>﹈<br>^1693713896391



﹇<br>
What do you notice about the below code?

```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "Hello");
    strcat(buffer, ", World!"); // buffer overflow here
    std::cout << buffer << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

In this example, `buffer` is an array of 10 characters, but we’re trying to concatenate a string of 13 characters into it using `strcat()`. This causes a buffer overflow because `strcat()` doesn’t check the size of the destination buffer and writes past the end of it.

﹇<br>
What is the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`?  

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

`strcpy()` and `strcat()` are both functions used to manipulate strings in C and C++. They are both defined in the `string.h` header file.

- `strcpy()` is used to copy a string from one location to another. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the copied string will be stored, and a source string that will be copied. The function copies the entire source string (including the null character) to the destination buffer.
- `strcat()` is used to concatenate two strings. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the concatenated string will be stored, and a source string that will be appended to the end of the destination string. The function appends the entire source string (including the null character) to the end of the destination string.

Here’s an example that demonstrates the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`:
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello";
    char str2[20] = ", World!";
    char str3[20];
    strcpy(str3, str1); // str3 now contains "Hello"
    strcat(str3, str2); // str3 now contains "Hello, World!"
    std::cout << str3 << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, `str1` is an array of characters initialized with the string `"Hello"`, and `str2` is an array of characters initialized with the string `", World!"`. `str3` is an array of 20 characters. The first call to `strcpy()` copies the contents of `str1` into `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello"`. The call to `strcat()` appends the contents of `str2` to the end of `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello, World!"`.

What is the optimal solution to this program?

```cpp
#include <string>
std::string greet(std::string s) {
  // todo
  return "hey " + s;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}

Do string literals exist in Python?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/python

Yes, they do.

In Python, string literals are sequences of characters surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.
- For example `'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.

﹇<br>
Is JavaScript a **compiled** or **interpreted** language? 

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

Neither. JavaScript defies classification because at a very technical level it is compiled before being interpreted by the browser line by line.

Some still classify JavaScript as an interpreted language…
- For instance, an article from Stanford states that JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More *modern* browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

﹇<br>
What are some of JavaScript’s primitive data types?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript 

JavaScript's primitive types include:
1.  `String`: Represents a sequence of characters, such as `"Hello, world!"`.
2.  `Number`: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., `42` or `3.14`.
3.  `BigInt`: Represents integers of arbitrary length, e.g., `9007199254740991n`.
4.  `Boolean`: Represents a true or false value, e.g., `true` or `false`.
5.  `Null`: Represents a value that intentionally has no value or reference, e.g., `null`.
6.  `Undefined`: Represents a value that has not been assigned, e.g., `undefined`.
7.  `Symbol`: Represents a unique and immutable value, typically used as object property keys, e.g., `Symbol('description')`.

﹇<br>
Are primitive types in JavaScript objects?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

While primitive types are not objects and don't have methods themselves, JavaScript automatically wraps them in corresponding object wrappers when you try to access their methods, allowing you to use methods like `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`.

⌂

﹇<br>
What does `prototype` mean in the method `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`? 

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

In JavaScript, <span class="spoiler">`prototype`</span> is a property of a constructor function that is used to define shared properties and methods for all instances created using that constructor.

﹇<br>
How does JavaScript implement inheritance? 

#card-reverse #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it uses a **prototypical** inheritance.

This is instead of classical inheritance as seen in languages like Java or C++.

⌂
<br>﹈<br>^1693713896643





﹇<br>
What happens when an object is created in JavaScript? 

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

When an object is created in JavaScript, it gets an internal reference to its "prototype" object. 
- This prototype object is used to look up properties and methods that are not directly defined on the object itself. 
- If a requested property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript will search the prototype chain, which is a series of connected prototype objects, until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (which is `null`).

For example, when you create an array in JavaScript, it is an instance of the `Array` constructor:
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
```
This array instance has access to methods like `push`, `pop`, and `slice`. 

These methods are not defined directly on the `arr` object but are instead defined on the `Array.prototype` object. 
- When you call a method on `arr`,JavaScript looks up the method in the prototype chain, ultimately finding it on `Array.prototype`.

﹇<br>
Is using prototypes efficient? 

#card-reverse #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/javascript

Using <span class="spoiler">prototypes</span> allows for more efficient memory usage.

This is because shared <span class="spoiler">properties</span> and methods are defined only once on the <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>, rather than on each instance of the object.

This also makes it easy to extend or modify the behavior of all instances of a constructor, by simply modifying the constructor’s <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>.
