### **014. five sort 👨🏽‍💻**

#### Solution (C++)

What is/are the most **optimal** solution(s) for this problem? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach #1**: Just use the `partition?()` function from the algorithm library.
	- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### **Attempt #1 (2023-01-08) ⏲️ 00:05:45**

Does `sort()` have the capability to sort all elements of a certain type to the end or beginning of a container? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, it does not. For the objective, one should use the `partition()` function.

What function should one use if they wish to sort all elements of a certain type to the end or beginning of a container? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Use the `partition()` function. 
^1690880013717

How many arguments does `partition()` have? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
It has three arguments…
	1. A `ForwardIterator` for the starting position of the iteration
	2. A `ForwardIterator` for the ending position of the iteration
	3. A predicate.       
An example of a predicate…
```cpp
[](int i){ return i != 5}
``` 
 *Essentially all values that values that return true will **precede** all values that return false.*

What predicate should I make if I want to move all elements that are 5 to the end of a vector? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
[](int i){ return i != 5}
```
Notice the change not equal sign.

What predicate should I make if I want to move all elements that are 5 to the front of a vector? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
[](int i){ return i == 5}
```
Notice the equal sign.

What is the difference between `stable_partition()` and `partition()`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
`stable_partition` preserves the order of elements.

What is the time complexity of `partition()`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
^1690880013752

Is the generic function `partition(n)` in-place? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Yes.
^1690880013756

What is the time complexity of `stable_partition()`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
`std::space_partition()` is an adaptive algorithm, which means the time complexity depends on the amount of memory available.
- If enough memory available, the function can use a buffer to achieve a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
	- Space complexity in this case is $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- If there is not enough memory available, the function uses an in-place approach with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
	- Space complexity in this case is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ 
^1690880013761

What is the space complexity of `stable_partition()`? 
#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp
There are **2 implementations**.
- "slower" `O(n*logn)` implementation
- "faster" `O(n)` implementation
The **fast** implementation however needs to **use a lot of memory**, which may not be available. So the `stable_partition` asks the operating system if there is enough memory available and then chooses between the two implementations.
