Can Bash be considered a programming language?

#card 

Yes, Bash can be considered a programming language. [It is primarily a command interpreter, but it also has programming elements](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/understanding-bash-elements-programming)\[[[#^vladimirlikicUnderstandingBashElements2018|1]]\]. According to the Bash manual, Bash is described as a ‚Äúsh-compatible command language‚Äù. [This ‚Äúcommand language‚Äù is a programming language through which a user communicates with the operating system or an application](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28693737/is-bash-a-programming-language)\[[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28693737/is-bash-a-programming-language)\].

[Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)\]. [It has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)\[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)\].

[So, if you have experience with Bash, it‚Äôs definitely worth mentioning as a programming language skill](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28693737/is-bash-a-programming-language)\[[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28693737/is-bash-a-programming-language)\].
