What is the command to list all git worktrees in a repo?

#card 

The command to list all git worktrees in a repository is:

```bash
git worktree list
```

This command will display the path of each worktree and the branch currently checked out in that worktree. It‚Äôs a handy way to manage multiple branches in the same repository without having to switch back and forth. Remember to run this command in the root directory of your git repository.
‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
So while a folder naming structure is allowed in naming git branches, it seems that at most you can only have one folder _not_ multiple when naming a git branch.

#card 

Yes, you‚Äôre correct. While Git does allow you to use a folder-like structure in your branch names using the `/` character, it‚Äôs important to note that Git doesn‚Äôt actually have a concept of folders for branches. The `/` character is just another valid character that can be used in a branch name, much like a `-` or `_`.

However, many people use the `/` character in their branch names to organize their branches in a way that‚Äôs similar to folders and subfolders. For example, you might have `feature/login` and `feature/signup` branches.

But remember, while you can use multiple `/` characters in a branch name (like `feature/user/login`), it doesn‚Äôt create nested folders. It‚Äôs just part of the branch name. When you list your branches with `git branch`, Git doesn‚Äôt display them in a nested or tree structure. It just lists all the branches flatly, but they will be sorted alphabetically so branches with the same prefixes will be grouped together.

So, in essence, you can use one or more `/` characters in your branch names as a way to categorize them, but Git doesn‚Äôt treat these as actual folders or subfolders.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>


Ôπá<br>
While it is possible, it seems that using multiple `/` when naming a git branch has the unintended result of not working correctly with git worktrees.

#card 

Yes, you‚Äôre correct. Using multiple `/` characters in a branch name can cause issues when working with git worktrees. The reason for this is that git worktrees create a new directory for each branch. [If a branch name contains multiple `/` characters, it can be interpreted as a directory structure, which can cause confusion and unexpected behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31935776/what-would-i-use-git-worktree-for)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31935776/what-would-i-use-git-worktree-for)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31871888/what-goes-wrong-when-using-git-worktree-with-git-submodules)[3](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/164363)[4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39665570/why-can-two-git-worktrees-not-check-out-the-same-branch)[5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69125521/does-one-git-worktree-support-multiple-branches).

For example, if you have a branch named `feature/user/login`, git worktrees might interpret this as wanting to create a `feature` directory with a `user` subdirectory, and then a `login` subdirectory under that. This can lead to issues if you also have other branches that start with `feature/user`, as it would imply they should all be located in the same `feature/user` directory.

So while git does allow you to use multiple `/` characters in your branch names, it‚Äôs generally best to avoid doing so if you‚Äôre planning on using git worktrees. Instead, consider using a different character, like `-` or `_`, to separate different parts of your branch names.

How can I modify my local git repository to allow longer file names?

#card 

To modify your local Git repository to allow longer file names, you can change the `core.longpaths` setting to `true`. This can be done by running the following command in your Git Bash:

```bash
git config --system core.longpaths true
```

This command changes the configuration of Git on your system to enable long paths. If you want to apply this setting only to a specific repository, you can use the `--local` option instead of `--system`:

```bash
git config --local core.longpaths true
```

This command needs to be run in the root directory of the repository for which you want to enable long paths. Please note that this setting is available in Git 2.9.0 and later.

Remember, this is a workaround for Windows users, as Windows has a maximum path length of 260 characters by default. If you‚Äôre frequently dealing with long file paths, you might want to consider restructuring your directories to avoid deeply nested structures.

How to rename a branch?

Ôπá<br>
What is important to remember when renaming branches locally? 

#card-reverse 

- Note that renaming a branch only affects your local repository.
- If you have already pushed the branch to a remote repository, you will need to update the remote repository as well. You can do this by deleting the old branch from the remote repository and pushing the new branch:
```bash
# Delete the old branch from the remote repository
git push origin --delete old-name
# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push origin new-name
```

How do you rename an existing remote? 

#card-reverse 

`git remote rename [old name] [new name]`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1697930420730


Ôπá<br>
Does renaming an existing remote, also rename the repository name on the hosting provider? (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)? 

#card 

No, the `git remote rename` command only renames the remote in your local repository. It does not change the name of the repository on GitHub or any other remote hosting service. If you want to rename your repository on GitHub, you can do so through the repository settings on the GitHub website.

How to configure git to always **push the current branch and set the remote as upstream**¬†automatically every time you push? 

#card-reverse 

Run the following command‚Ä¶

`git config --global --add --bool push.autoSetupRemote true`

The <span class="spoiler">`--global`</span>¬†flag means this will apply to all git commands on your machine (regardless of which repo it is), you can omit the flag to make it specific to a single repo on your machine.

In regards to `.gitignore`, how to fix Visual Studio Code still tracking changes of files that should be ignored? 

#card 

There could be a few reasons why VS Code is still recognizing files that are in your `.gitignore` file.

One possibility is that the files were added to your cache.

What is the **GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow**? 

#card 

1. Create a fork, _usually_ you should only include the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù (e.g. `master` or `main`) branch from the upstream (i.e., the repository we are forking from).
2. Create a branch off the original ‚Äúdefault‚Äù and call it .
3. Then submit a pull request when done.

What is the opposite of git add? 

#card-reverse 

The opposite of¬†`git add`¬†is¬†`git reset`. The¬†`git add`¬†command stages changes to be committed, while the¬†`git reset`¬†command unstages changes. Here‚Äôs an example:

```bash
# Stage changes to file.txt
git add file.txt
# Unstage changes to file.txt
git reset file.txt
```

This will unstage the changes to¬†`file.txt`¬†that were previously staged using¬†`git add`. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

So I just cloned a repo, and I having a weird issue. Right now, I am working on brnach `A`, However, I have a branch on my origin called `B`. For some reason, when I call `git fetch`, and then run `git branch -l`, the branch `B` is not being shown as a branch in the list. Only the branch `A` is being shown. What gives? 

#card 

- The `git branch` command, without any parameters, only shows your local branches. [When you fetch, information about your remote branches is updated, but it will only be shown when you use `git branch -r` (only remote branches) or `git branch -a` (all remote and local branches)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to see the remote branch `B` after fetching it, you can use the command `git branch -a`. [This will show you a list of all local and remote branches, including the remote branch `B`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to checkout the remote branch `B`, you can use the command `git checkout B`. This will create a new local branch called `B` that tracks the remote branch `B`. After checking out the remote branch, you should be able to see it when running the `git branch` command[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).

What does `git saubmodule add` do? 

#card 

1. **Clones the Submodule:** Starts by cloning the repository provided via a URL into the path specified in your current repository
2. **Stages the Changes:** Stages the new submodule.
3. **Commits the Changes:** The changes can be committed as usual with `git commit`.

When other clone or pull your repository, they need to use the `--recursive` flag to ensure that the submodules are properly initialized‚Ä¶

```bash
git clone --recursive [URL-to-your-repository]
```

Submodules are not automatically updated, nor do they track the origin. As such, if the remote repository is updated, you won‚Äôt automatically get those changes in your repository; you need to to manually update the submodule to point to a newer commit.

As of Git 2.28 (released 27th July 2020), you¬†[can now configure the name of the branch created when you init a new repository](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-highlights-from-git-2-28/#introducing-init-defaultbranch):

```powershell
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

After setting this variable, running¬†`git init`¬†will produce a repository whose initial branch is¬†`main`:

```powershell
$ git init
Initialised empty Git repository in /home/thomas/test-git-repo/.git/
$ git status

No commits yet
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

What does `git fetch origin` do?

#card 

`git fetch` is the command that tells Git to fetch changes from a remote repository.

`origin` in `git fetch origin` specifies which remote repository to fetch from. When you clone a repository, Git automatically names the repository you've cloned from as "origin", though you can have multiple remotes with different names.
 
 Now, what does `git fetch` actually do?
   1. **Downloads Objects and Refs**: It contacts the specified remote (in this case, "origin"), and downloads any new changes (objects like commits, trees, blobs) and references (like branches and tags) that you don't have in your local repository.
   2. **Updates Remote-tracking Branches**: When you fetch from a remote, Git will also update what are called "remote-tracking branches". These are references to the state of branches on the remote repositories. They take the format `<remote>/<branch>`. For instance, after running `git fetch origin`, if the origin has a branch named `master`, your local repo will have an updated reference named `origin/master` that tracks the state of the `master` branch on `origin`.
   3. **Does NOT Merge or Modify Working Directory**: Unlike `git pull`, which is essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge` (or `git rebase`), `git fetch` on its own does not modify your current working branch or your working directory. It merely fetches the new data and updates the remote-tracking branches.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>^1697930420959

Ôπá<br>
Why is `git fetch origin` so useful?

#card

It allows you to see changes from the remote repository without integrating them into your local branch immediately. This provides you an opportunity to review changes, decide on a merge or rebase strategy, or even just be aware of what's happening in other parts of the project.

It is a safe operation in that it won't affect your local branches or working directory. So, you can run `git fetch` at any time to get updated information from the remote without worrying about disturbing your current work. 

In the context of the problem you were facing, `git fetch origin` ensures you have the latest state of the `master` branch from `origin` before you perform the reset operation.

Lets consider the case that you have a repo in which you are having merge conflict like so‚Ä¶

Ôπá<br>
Why do we need to cautious about `git reset --hard`?

#card 

Be cautious with `git reset --hard` as it will discard changes in your working directory and index.

If you've made local commits that you want to keep, you'll need to take a different approach (like creating a new branch for those commits or rebasing).

Ôπá<br>
So, even though my local repository is based on my `origin` (hosted on GitHub) being a fork (i.e., the `upstream`) of my original repository, when I run the command `git branch -la`, the output is not listing any `upstream` branches. How can I fix this?

#card 

If you are not seeing an `upstream` remote when you run `git branch -la`, it means that an `upstream` remote has not been added to your local clone. The `upstream` remote typically refers to the original repository that your fork was created from, and it allows you to keep your fork up to date with changes made in the original repository.

You can add an `upstream` remote to your local clone by running the following command:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/original-repo.git
```

Make sure to replace `original-owner` and `original-repo` with the username of the owner of the original repository and the name of the original repository, respectively.

After adding the `upstream` remote, you can fetch changes from the original repository by running `git fetch upstream`. You can then merge these changes into your local branch by running `git merge upstream/branch-name`, where `branch-name` is the name of the branch that you want to merge changes from.

Is `git fetch` the same as `git fetch --all`?

#card 

[The command `git fetch` fetches data only from the default remote, which is usually `origin`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all). On the other hand, `git fetch --all` fetches data from all remotes[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all). So if you have multiple remotes configured for your repository, `git fetch --all` will fetch from all of them[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36630490/git-fetch-origin-vs-git-fetch-all).

[Additionally, if you want to remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the remote before fetching, you can use the `-p` or `--prune` flag with the `git fetch` command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference). [For example, `git fetch --all -p` would fetch from all remotes and prune any references that no longer exist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference)[2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59685267/git-fetch-all-vs-git-fetch-p-what-is-the-difference).

After I run the command `git submodule init`, the directory that should be containing the submodule is empty. Why is this the case and how can I fix this?

#card 

After running `git submodule init`, the submodule directory may still appear empty. This is because `git submodule init` only initializes the local configuration file for the submodule, but it does not actually fetch the data from the submodule repository.

[To fetch the data from the submodule repository and populate the submodule directory, you need to run `git submodule update --init`](about:blank#)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11358082/empty-git-submodule-folder-when-repo-cloned).

[If you have already cloned the repository but forgot to use the `--recursive` flag, you can still fetch the submodules by running `git submodule update --init`](about:blank#)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11358082/empty-git-submodule-folder-when-repo-cloned).
- [If submodules have other submodules, you need to use the recursive option: `git submodule update --init --recursive`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11358082/empty-git-submodule-folder-when-repo-cloned)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11358082/empty-git-submodule-folder-when-repo-cloned).
