﹇<br>
How can you set an element in a SVG to have their color inherited from the parent HTML element's color attribute?

#card 


HTML uses color whereas SVG uses fill and stroke. You can get fill or stroke to use the value of the color CSS property by using the value `currentColor` e.g. `fill="currentColor"`
