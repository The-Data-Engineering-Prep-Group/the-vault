#### 🧭 Approach


﹇<br>
What is the mathematical definition of a prime number?

#card 

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself<sup>[\[1\]](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html)</sup>. More concisely, a prime number is a positive integer having exactly one positive divisor other than 1, meaning it is a number that cannot be factored<sup>[\[1\]](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html)</sup>. For example, the only divisors of 13 are 1 and 13, making 13 a prime number<sup>[\[1\]](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html)</sup>. The numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers<sup>[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)</sup>.

﹇<br>
Must a prime number be greater than 1?

#card 

Yes, a prime number must be greater than 1. By definition, a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.

﹇<br>
What is the general optimal (i.e. think shortcut) approach for finding if a number is a prime number?

#card 

Instead of iterating from $2 < n$, you can just iterate from $2 \leq \sqrt{n}$ since this approach will cover _all_ potential factors of $n$ that could conclude that it is, or not, a prime number.

With this approach, we reduce our time complexity from $\mathcal{O}{(n)}$ to $\mathcal{O}{\sqrt{n}}$.

#### 📽️ Walkthrough

##### C++

﹇<br>
Is the following code valid?

```cpp
bool isPrime(int n) {
  // todo
  // Prime number is any number that is only divisible by 1 and itself
  
  // Know that we can iterate from 2 to sqrt(n); because sqrt(n) upper limit of possible combinations of valeujs
  
  if(n == 0 || n == 1) {
    return false;
  }
  
  for(int num {2}; num < sqrt(n); num++) {
    if(n % num ==  0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

#card 

- First off, the _condition_ of the for loop should be `num <= sqrt(n)`.
- It is easier, and more readable to just write 
	```cpp
	(n < 2)
	```
	than write 
	```
	(n == 0 || n == 1)
	```

###### Notes


﹇<br>
When trying to determine if a number $n$ is prime, what is the range one must iterate over so that they can check all possible divisors of $n$?  

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- Need to iterate from $2$ to $\lfloor{\sqrt{ n }}\rfloor$ 
- Remember that 0 and 1 are ***not*** prime numbers
- Also, any negative numbers are not prime numbers.

What are common properties that all iterators must satisfy in C++?

What type of iterators do different containers like `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::forward_list`, `std::set`, and `std::map` provide in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- `std::vector` provides random access iterators

﹇<br>
How can inserting elements into a container invalidate iterators in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Inserting elements might cause reallocation (e.g., in `std::vector`), changing the memory locations of the elements and invalidating iterators pointing to old locations.

﹇<br>
How can removing elements from a container invalidate iterators in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Removing elements invalidates iterators that point to the removed elements, and possibly others depending on the container and operation.

﹇<br>
How can reallocation in a container like `std::vector` invalidate iterators in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Reallocation might occur when a container grows, invalidating all iterators, pointers, and references to elements in the container.

﹇<br>
How can changing a key in associative containers like `std::set` or `std::map` invalidate iterators in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Modifying a key in a way that affects the ordering will invalidate the iterator.

﹇<br>
How can calling non-const member functions on a container invalidate iterators in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

Some non-const member functions might invalidate iterators depending on the specific container and the operation performed.

﹇<br>
What does it mean to invalidate an iterator in C++?

#card #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

An iterator is invalidated when it no longer refers to a valid element, making its use undefined behavior. This can occur due to operations such as insertions, deletions, reallocation, etc.

#card-reverse  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- A <span class="spoiler">**prime number**</span> (or a <span class="spoiler">**prime**</span>) is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") greater than 1 that is not a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") of two smaller natural numbers.

What is the most optimal approach to solving this problem?  

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- Iterate from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ to iterate through all potential divisors of the number $n$ that could be a factor proving that $n$ is not a prime number 
- To better visualize, take a look at this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/geometry-beta/2zvelza7ht).

If one divisor of a number is a factor, does that mean its corresponding divisor is a factor also?  

#card  #🔴-academics/📚-educational-resources/discipline/computer-science/programming-language/cpp

- Yes, that's correct. If a number 'b' is a divisor of a number 'a', then 'b' is a factor of 'a'. Similarly, the corresponding quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' is also a factor of 'a'.
- For example, consider the number 12. The divisors (or factors) of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. When you divide 12 by 2, you get 6. Here, both 2 and 6 are divisors of 12. Similarly, dividing 12 by 3 gives 4. Both 3 and 4 are also divisors (factors) of 12.
- In general, for any number 'a', if it can be expressed as a product 'b * c', then both 'b' and 'c' are factors (divisors) of 'a'.
