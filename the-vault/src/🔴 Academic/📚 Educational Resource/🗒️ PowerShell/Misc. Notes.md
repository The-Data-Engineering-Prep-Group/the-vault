Ôπá<br>
What happens when you create a symbolic link? 

#card 

You are creating a shortcut to an other file or directory.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184347

Ôπá<br>
Does the symbolic link take up a lot of space in your hard drive? 

#card 

No, this is why it can save you space by allowing you to have multiple copies of the same file in different locations without actually taking up the space for each copy.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184353

Ôπá<br>
How do you create  symbolic link in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

You can use the `New-Item` cmdlet with the `ItemType` `SymbolicLink` parameter.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184357

Ôπá<br>
What does the following code do? `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "Link" -Target "Target"` 

#card 

Creates a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *file* "Target".

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184360

Ôπá<br>
Can you create symbolic links to *directories* with PowerShell on Windows? 

#card 

Yes. For example, to create a symbolic link called "Link" that points to the *directory* "Target", you can use the following command: `New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "Link" -Target "Target"`

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184363

Ôπá<br>
What are some of the upsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

If you have multiple copies of the same file in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create shortcuts to the file instead of actually copying the file to each location. This can save you a lot of space, especially if the file is large.

If you have a lot of files in different locations, you can use <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span> to create a central location for all of your files. This can make it easier to find the files you need and to keep track of what files you have.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184366

Ôπá<br>
What are some of the downsides of symbolic links in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

If you create a <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span> and it does not work, it can be difficult to figure out why.

When you access a <span class="spoiler">symbolic links</span>, the operating system has to first find the original file before it can access the file you are trying to access. This can add a few milliseconds to the time it takes to access a file.

Ôπá<br>
What is a cmdlet in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment.

The PowerShell runtime invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line.

The PowerShell runtime also invokes them programmatically through PowerShell APIs.

Cmdlets perform an action and typically return a Microsoft .NET object to the next command in the pipeline.

A cmdlet is a single command that participates in the pipeline semantics of PowerShell.

This includes binary (C#) cmdlets, advanced script functions, CDXML, and Workflows.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184372

A {1:cmdlet} is a lightweight command that is used in the PowerShell environment. 
^1683681712863 

The {1:PowerShell runtime} invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line. 
^1683681712871 

Ôπá<br>
What do cmdlets typically return? 

#card 

A Microsoft .NET object to the next pipeline.

Ôπá<br>
What does `$PWD` mean in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse 

<span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> is an automatic variable in PowerShell that contains the full path of the current directory.

It is a shortcut for <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>. To get the current directory, you can use either <span class="spoiler">`$PWD`</span> or <span class="spoiler">`Get-Location`</span>.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

explorer.exe .
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>
^1682809184383

Ôπá<br>
How to test if a file or path exists in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse 

Use the cmdlet `Test-Path`.

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
Test-Path -Path "C:\Documents and Settings\DavidC"
True
```

This command checks whether all elements in the path exist, that is, the¬†`C:`¬†directory, the¬†`Documents and Settings`¬†directory, and the¬†`DavidC`¬†directory. If any are missing, the cmdlet returns¬†`$False`. Otherwise, it returns¬†`$True`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
How can you enforce the type of a variable in PowerShell? 

#card 

In PowerShell, you can enforce the type of a variable by using type accelerators or by casting the value to the desired type when you assign it to the variable. 

For example:¬†

```cpp
[int] $myInt = 10
```

or

```cpp
$myInt = [int] 10
```

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
What are type accelerators in PowerShell? 

#card-reverse  

<span class="spoiler">Type accelerators</span> are aliases for .NET framework classes. They allow you to access specific .NET framework classes without having to explicitly type the entire class name.
- For example, you can shorten the¬†**AliasAttribute**¬†class from¬†`[System.Management.Automation.AliasAttribute]`¬†to¬†`[Alias]`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
What are some common types in PowerShell? 

#card 

Some common types in PowerShell include¬†`System.String`,¬†`System.Int32`,¬†`System.Boolean`,¬†`System.DateTime`,¬†`System.Array`,¬†`System.Collections.ArrayList`, and¬†`System.Collections.Hashtable`. PowerShell also has its own set of types that are specific to the language, such as¬†`PSCustomObject`,¬†`PSObject`, and¬†`SwitchParameter`.

‚åÇ
<br>Ôπà<br>

Ôπá<br>
 What is the definition of a symbolic link? 

#card 

A <span class="spoiler">symbolic link</span>, also known as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file that points to another file or directory.

<span class="spoiler">Symbolic links</span> are a useful tool for managing your files. However, it is important to be aware of the downsides before you start using them.

Can you assign an alias to a command with parameters in PowerShell? 
#card 
- You **cannot** assign an alias to a command with parameters using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`.
- Instead, you can create a function that contains the command with parameters and then assign an alias to that function.
- For example, if you wanted to create an alias named¬†`list`¬†for the¬†`Get-ChildItem`¬†cmdlet with the¬†`-Force`¬†parameter, you could create a function like this:
	```PowerShell
	function Get-ChildItem-Force { Get-ChildItem -Force }
	```
	Then, you could create an alias for the function using¬†`Set-Alias`¬†or¬†`New-Alias`:
	```PowerShell
	Set-Alias -Name list -Value Get-ChildItem-Force
	```

**Front:**¬†How do you pass arguments to a PowerShell script? 
#card 
**Back:**¬†You can pass arguments to a PowerShell script by defining them using the¬†`param`¬†statement at the beginning of your script.
^1683584331568

**Front:**¬†How do you define arguments in a PowerShell script? 
#card 
**Back:**¬†You can define arguments in a PowerShell script using the¬†`param`¬†statement. For example:¬†`param(ÔºÑname, ÔºÑaddress = "USA", ÔºÑage)`.
^1683584331574

**Front:**¬†How do you call a PowerShell script with arguments? 
#card 
**Back:**¬†You can call a PowerShell script with arguments like this:¬†`powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25`.
^1683584331578

**Front:** How do you define a default value for a parameter in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back:** You can define a script¬†`myscript.ps1`¬†that takes in arguments for¬†`name`,¬†`address`, and¬†`age`¬†like this:
```PowerShell
param($name, $address = "USA", $age)
Write-Host "Name: $name"
Write-Host "Address: $address"
Write-Host "Age: $age"
```
Here, the variable¬†`$address`¬†has a default value of¬†`"USA"`. You can then call this script with arguments like this:
```PowerShell
powershell.exe -file myscript.ps1 -name "John" -address "Canada" -age 25
```
[This will pass the values¬†`"John"`,¬†`"Canada"`, and¬†`25`¬†to the¬†`$name`,¬†`$address`, and¬†`$age`¬†variables respectively](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/powershell/pass-an-argument-to-a-powershell-script/)
^1683898509522


How can you combine a path and child-path? 
#card 
`Join-Path`¬†is a cmdlet in PowerShell that combines a path and child-path into a single path.¬†The provider supplies the path delimiters[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3).¬†For example, if you want to combine a path with a child path, you can use¬†`Join-Path -Path "path" -ChildPath "childpath"`¬†which will return¬†`path\childpath`[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-7.3)
^1683898614447


What is the target of a symbolic link? 
#card 
A symbolic link is a file whose purpose is to point to another file or directory (called the ‚Äútarget‚Äù) by specifying a path thereto. The object being pointed to is called the target.

In PowerShell, to print the current host you can use the cmdlet {`Get-Host`}.
^1683898370405

What is the command to install all font type extension in Windows? 
#card 
Currently, there is not a singular cmdlet in PowerShell to install fonts. In order to install fonts in PowerShell, you need to move all the appropriate files to the  `C:\Windows\fonts\` folder.
^1684498554648

The alias for the `Get-Location` cmdlet is {pwd}
^1684687243973

What is wrong with following PowerShell command?
```powershell
Get-Command | $_.Source
```
#card 
- The problem with the command is the use of `$_` outside of a script block `{}`.
- The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline, but it's only accessible within a script block.
- Here's the corrected command:
```powershell
Get-Command node | ForEach-Object { $_.Source }
```

**Front**: What is the difference between `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` in PowerShell? 
#card 
**Back**: `Get-Item` gets the item at the specified location, while `Get-ChildItem` gets the items and child items in one or more specified locations. In other words, `Get-Item` returns information about the targeted item itself, whereas `Get-ChildItem` returns information about the targeted item's children, if the given item happens to be a container ¬π.

What is wrong with the following PowerShell scripting code?
```pwsh
$currentDirectory = $Get-Location
```
#card 
When using the `Get-Location` cmdlet in PowerShell, it does *not* require the `$` symbol.
^1690892249714

What is the problem with the following code? 
#card 
```pwsh
Write-Host $currentDirectory > tmp.txt
```
#card 
- Write-Host sends information directly to the console, no to a file. If you want to write the value of $currentDirectory to a file, you should use either `Out-File` or `Set-Content`. For example‚Ä¶
	- `$currentDirectory | Out-File "tmp.txt"`
	- `Set-Content -Path "tmp.txt" -Value $currentDirectory`
^1690892249721

How can I use `Set-Content` to write the value of `$currentDirectory` to the file `tmp.txt`? 
#card-reverse 
`Set-Content -Path "tmp.txt" -Value $currentDirectory`
^1690892249727

How can I use `Out-File` to write the value of `$currentDirectory` to the file `tmp.txt` 
#card-reverse 
`$currentDirectory | Out-File "tmp.txt"`
^1690892249735

If you want to append new content to a file, you can use¬†{`Out-File`}. If you want to replace the existing content with new content, you can use¬†{`Set-Content`}.¬†[You should also consider the encoding of the data when choosing which cmdlet to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10655788/powershell-set-content-and-out-file-what-is-the-difference). 
^1691990373869
#card
^1690892249742

By default, `Out-File` saves data to a file in what encoding? 
#card 
Unicode (UTF-16LE) *This can be specified
^1690892249751

By default, `Set-Content` defaults to what encoding? 
#card 
ASCII (US-ASCII)
^1690892249758

What is a major difference between `Set-Content` and `Out-File`? 
#card 
- `Out-File` allows you append new content to a file using the `-Append` parameter
- `Set-Content` will replace existing content with new content
 
What is the difference between `Write-Host` and `Write-Information`? 
#card 
- `Write-Host` sends information directly to the console. As such, you can *not* pipe/transfer the output of Write-Host
- The output of `Write-Information` can be redirected using either the `>` redirection operator or using cmdlets such as `Out-File`
^1690892249765

Can you use `Out-File` or `>` to redirect the output of `Write-Host`? 
#card 
No!
^1690892249772

Can you use `Out-File` or `>` to redirect the output of `Write-Information`? 
#card 
Yes!
^1690892249779

Starting in PowerShell 5.0, is `Write-Host` a wrapper for `Write-Information`? 
#card 
Yes, although only explicitly calling the cmdlet `Write-Information` can you the output be redirected or reused.

What does the following PowerShell command do?
```powershell
$Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
```
#card 
[This command retrieves the `Path` environment variable for both the `Machine` and `User` scopes, concatenates them with a semicolon separator, and assigns the result to the `$Env:Path` variable in the current PowerShell session](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/)[1](https://shellgeek.com/powershell-refresh-environment-variables/). This will update the `Path` environment variable in the current session without needing to restart PowerShell.
