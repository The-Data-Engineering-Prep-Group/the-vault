What is a bind mount in Docker?

#card 

A bind mount in Docker lets you share a directory from your host‚Äôs filesystem into the container. It allows you to access data on your system from a container.

What does the¬†`volumes`¬†element do in a **Docker Compose** file in the context of a bind mount?

#card 

The¬†`volumes`¬†element tells Compose to mount the local folder (e.g.,¬†`./app`) to a specific path (e.g.,¬†`/usr/src/app`) in the container for the service (e.g.,¬†`todo-app`). This particular bind mount overwrites the static contents of the directory in the container and creates what is known as a development container.

Read the following `compose.yaml` file‚Ä¶

```yaml
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.
# If you need more help, visit the Docker compose reference guide at
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

# Here the instructions define your application as two services called "todo-app" and ‚Äútodo-database‚Äù
# The service ‚Äútodo-app‚Äù is built from the Dockerfile in the /app directory,
# and the service ‚Äútodo-database‚Äù uses the official MongoDB image 
# from Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo. 
# You can add other services your application may depend on here.

services: 
  todo-app: 
    build: 
      context: ./app
    links: 
      - todo-database
    volumes: 
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    ports: 
      - 3001:3001

  todo-database: 
    image: mongo:6
    command: mongod --port 27018
    ports: 
      - 27018:27018
```

What is the purpose of the second instruction¬†`/usr/src/app/node_modules`¬†in the¬†`volumes`¬†element?

#card 

The second instruction,¬†`/usr/src/app/node_modules`, prevents the bind mount from overwriting the container‚Äôs¬†`node_modules`¬†directory to preserve the packages installed in the container.

```yaml
# Comments are provided throughout this file to help you get started.

services: 
  todo-app: 
    build: 
      context: ./app
    links: 
      - todo-database
    volumes: 
      - ./app:/usr/src/app

    image: mongo:6
    command: mongod --port 27018
    ports: 
      - 27018:27018
```

Can you explain, line by line, what is happening in the following `compose.yaml` file?

#card 

```yaml
services: 
  todo-app: 
    build: 
      context: ./app
    links: 
      - todo-database
    volumes: 
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    ports: 
      - 3001:3001

  todo-database: 
    image: mongo:6
    command: mongod --port 27018
    ports: 
      - 27018:27018
```

- `services:`: This is the top-level element where you define all the services that make up your application.
- `build:`: This tells Docker to build an image for this service from a Dockerfile.
- `context: ./app`: This specifies the location of the Dockerfile. In this case, it‚Äôs in the `./app` directory.
- `links:`: This is where you define any services that this service depends on. In this case, `todo-app` depends on `todo-database`.
- `- todo-database`: This tells Docker that `todo-app` depends on `todo-database`.
- `volumes:`: This is where you define any volumes or bind mounts that you want to attach to this service.
- `- ./app:/usr/src/app`: This is a bind mount. It tells Docker to mount the `./app` directory from the host machine to the `/usr/src/app` directory in the `todo-app` container.
- `- /usr/src/app/node_modules`: This is another bind mount. It tells Docker to mount the `/usr/src/app/node_modules` directory from the host machine to the same directory in the `todo-app` container.
- `ports:`: This is where you define any ports that you want to expose from this service.
- `- 3001:3001`: This tells Docker to map port 3001 of the host machine to port 3001 of the `todo-app` container.
- `todo-database:`: This is the name of the second service. It‚Äôs a MongoDB database.
- `image: mongo:6`: This tells Docker to use the `mongo:6` image from Docker Hub for this service.
- `command: mongod --port 27018`: This is the command that Docker will run when it starts the `todo-database` container. In this case, it‚Äôs starting the MongoDB server on port 27018.
- `ports:`: This is where you define any ports that you want to expose from this service.
- `- 27018:27018`: This tells Docker to map port 27018 of the host machine to port 27018 of the `todo-database` container.

So, in summary, this configuration is setting up two services: `todo-app` and `todo-database`. The `todo-app` service is built from a Dockerfile in the `./app` directory and is linked to the `todo-database` service. It also has two bind mounts and exposes port 3001. The `todo-database` service uses the `mongo:6` image from Docker Hub, runs the MongoDB server on port 27018, and exposes this port.
