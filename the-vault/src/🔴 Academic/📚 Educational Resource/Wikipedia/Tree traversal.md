What is tree traversal in computer science?

#card 

Tree traversal, also known as tree search and walking the tree, is a form of graph traversal. It refers to the process of visiting (e.g., retrieving, updating, or deleting) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once.

How are tree traversals classified?

#card 

Tree traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.

Can the algorithms for tree traversal be generalized to other trees apart from binary trees?

#card 

Yes, the algorithms described for a binary tree may be generalized to other trees as well.
