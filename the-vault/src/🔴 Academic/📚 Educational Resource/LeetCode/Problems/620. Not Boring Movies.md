###### Notes

﹇<br>
Does SQL Server have a `MOD()` keyword like MySQL?

#card 

[In SQL Server, the modulus operation is performed using the `%` operator, not the `MOD()` function as in MySQL](about:blank#)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). [The `%` operator returns the remainder of one number divided by another](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). Here’s an example of how you can use it:

```sql
SELECT 38 % 5 AS Remainder;
```

[This will divide 38 by 5 and return the remainder, which is 3](about:blank#)[1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). So, while SQL Server doesn’t have a `MOD()` function like MySQL, you can achieve the same result using the `%` operator.
