Ôπá<br>
Is the following code a correct _and_ efficient solution to the problem?

```sql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT
    *
FROM 
    Cinema c
WHERE
    (c.id % 2 = 1) AND
    (c.id != NULL) AND
    (c.rating != 'boring')
ORDER BY
    c.rating DESC
```

#card 

No, there are a couple of issues with the T-SQL query:

1. In SQL, you should use `IS NOT NULL` instead of `!= NULL`. The `NULL` value is special and is not considered equal or unequal to any value, including itself. So, your condition should be `(c.id IS NOT NULL)`.

2. The condition `(c.rating != 'boring')` implies that the `rating` column is a string type. If `rating` is a numeric type, you‚Äôll need to adjust this condition accordingly.

Here‚Äôs the corrected code:

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM 
    Cinema c
WHERE
    (c.id % 2 = 1) AND
    (c.id IS NOT NULL) AND
    (c.rating != 'boring')
ORDER BY
    c.rating DESC
```

In computer science, is Is correctness the same as efficient?

Does SQL Server have a `MOD()` keyword like MySQL?

#card 

In SQL Server, the modulus operation is performed using the `%` operator, not the `MOD()` function as in MySQL [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). 

The `%` operator returns the remainder of one number divided by another [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). Here‚Äôs an example of how you can use it:

```sql
SELECT 38 % 5 AS Remainder;
```

This will divide 38 by 5 and return the remainder, which is 3 [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/modulo-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16). So, while SQL Server doesn‚Äôt have a `MOD()` function like MySQL, you can achieve the same result using the `%` operator.
