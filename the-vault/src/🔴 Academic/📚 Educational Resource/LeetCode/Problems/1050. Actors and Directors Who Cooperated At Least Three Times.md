In SQL Server, what is the `HAVING` clause? Give me some unique examples regarding how to use it.

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

The `HAVING` clause in SQL Server is used to filter the results of a query based on aggregate functions and groupings<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)</sup>. It was introduced because the `WHERE` keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)</sup>. The `HAVING` clause can be used with conditions such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=` and `<>`, where `!=` and `<>` both mean not equal to<sup>[\[2\]](https://www.sqlservertutorial.org/sql-server-having/)</sup>.

Here are some examples of how to use the `HAVING` clause:

1. **Filtering Groups Based on Aggregate Functions**:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CustomerID), 
        Country 
    FROM 
        Customers 
    GROUP BY 
        Country 
    HAVING 
        COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;
    ```
    
    This SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, but only includes countries with more than 5 customers<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)</sup>.
    
2. **Combining with ORDER BY**:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        COUNT(CustomerID), Country 
    FROM 
        Customers 
    GROUP BY 
        Country 
    HAVING 
        COUNT(CustomerID) > 5 
    ORDER BY 
        COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
    ```
    
    This SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted from high to low. It only includes countries with more than 5 customers<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)</sup>.
    
3. **Filtering Based on Multiple Conditions**:
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        Employees.LastName, 
        COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders 
    FROM 
        Orders INNER 
    JOIN 
        Employees 
        ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID 
    WHERE 
        LastName = 'Davolio' OR 
        LastName = 'Fuller' 
    GROUP BY 
        LastName 
    HAVING 
        COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
    ```
    
    This SQL statement lists if the employees “Davolio” or “Fuller” have registered more than 25 orders<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp)</sup>.

In SQL server, give an example of using the `HAVING` clause where we _don't_ use `COUNT`?

#card #🔴-academic/📚-educational-resource/discipline/computer-science/dbms/sql-server 

You can use the `HAVING` clause with other aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` etc. Here’s an example using the `AVG` function:

```sql
SELECT 
	SalesPerson, 
	AVG(SaleAmount) as AverageSales
FROM 
	Sales
GROUP BY 
	SalesPerson
HAVING 
	AVG(SaleAmount) > 2000;
```

In this SQL statement, we’re grouping sales by each salesperson and calculating their average sales amount. The `HAVING` clause is then used to filter out any salespeople whose average sales amount is less than 2000. So, the result will only include salespeople who have an average sales amount greater than 2000.
