## :TiNotes: Description

﹇<br>
What is the `root` of a binary tree?

#card 

The root of a binary tree is the topmost node, from which all other nodes in the tree descend. It’s the only node in the tree that has no parent. 

In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The root node serves as the starting point for many operations on a binary tree.

﹇<br>
In normal, not reverse, order traversal of a tree, what node is visited earlier? The left or right node?

#card 

In _normal_ ordered traversal, the **left** node is visited earlier.

In _reverse_ ordered traversal, the **right** node is visited earlier.

When implementing an _iterative_ version of {1:depth-first search (DFS)}, one should use a {2:**stack**}.
