> [!warning] Convention for the First Header of Files!
> If the current file is considered a section, or bookmark, of a larger source, `<h1/>` should ***always*** be the name of the source. Usually this should just be a copy of the folder name the current file is in.
>
> If the current file is a standalone (i.e. classified as a  “notepad” 🗒️ for broad concepts), then `<h1/>` should just be the name of the file.
