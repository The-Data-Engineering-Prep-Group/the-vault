What is a **string literal** in C++? #card-reverse 
- Also, known as an **anonymous string**, is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code.
- Is essentially text between double quotes
	- For example: `"Hey World"`
^1684976004801


Should I use `strcat()`? #card
- No, strcat() is considered unsafe. 
- This is because there is nothing to stop you from `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence buffer, with undefined results up to and including‚Ä¶
	- heap corruption
	- stack corruption
	- program exit
	- even somebody owning your machine if the data past the 100th byte is appropriately constructed.
		- This is a common class of security vulnerability called a buffer overflow
- To avoid this, use `stdÍûâÍûâstring`‚Äôs operator+ 
^1684976004805


What is a **buffer overflow**? #card-reverse 
When you input more data that the buffer allows. For example, consider `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence.
^1684976004809

What do you notice about the below code?
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "Hello");
    strcat(buffer, ", World!"); // buffer overflow here
    stdÍûâÍûâcout << buffer << stdÍûâÍûâendl;
    return 0;
}
```
#card 
In this example,¬†`buffer`¬†is an array of 10 characters, but we‚Äôre trying to concatenate a string of 13 characters into it using¬†`strcat()`. This causes a buffer overflow because¬†`strcat()`¬†doesn‚Äôt check the size of the destination buffer and writes past the end of it.
^1684976004814

What is the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`? #card 
- `strcpy()`¬†and¬†`strcat()`¬†are both functions used to manipulate strings in C and C++. They are both defined in the¬†`string.h`¬†header file.
- `strcpy()`¬†is used to copy a string from one location to another. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the copied string will be stored, and a source string that will be copied. The function copies the entire source string (including the null character) to the destination buffer.
- `strcat()`¬†is used to concatenate two strings. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the concatenated string will be stored, and a source string that will be appended to the end of the destination string. The function appends the entire source string (including the null character) to the end of the destination string.
- Here‚Äôs an example that demonstrates the difference between¬†`strcpy()`¬†and¬†`strcat()`:
```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello";
    char str2[20] = ", World!";
    char str3[20];
    strcpy(str3, str1); // str3 now contains "Hello"
    strcat(str3, str2); // str3 now contains "Hello, World!"
    stdÍûâÍûâcout << str3 << stdÍûâÍûâendl;
    return 0;
}
```
- In this example,¬†`str1`¬†is an array of characters initialized with the string¬†`"Hello"`, and¬†`str2`¬†is an array of characters initialized with the string¬†`", World!"`.¬†`str3`¬†is an array of 20 characters. The first call to¬†`strcpy()`¬†copies the contents of¬†`str1`¬†into¬†`str3`, so¬†`str3`¬†now contains¬†`"Hello"`. The call to¬†`strcat()`¬†appends the contents of¬†`str2`¬†to the end of¬†`str3`, so¬†`str3`¬†now contains¬†`"Hello, World!"`.
^1684976004818

##### Approach

Do I need to declare another variable for this problem? #card 
No, can simply return the necessary value as follows‚Ä¶
`return "hey " + str`
^1684976004822


##### Solution

What is the optimal solution to this program? #card 
```cpp
#include <string>
std::string greet(stdÍûâÍûâstring s) {
  // todo
  return "hey " + s;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```
^1687753213806

What is the time computational complexity of the above algorithm? #card 
- Space: 
	- $O(1)$ *\*Without considering size of input and output strings*
- Time: $O(1)$
^1687753213810


#### Python

##### Problem

What is the `pass` keyword in Python? #card-reverse 
- <span class="spoiler">`pass`</span> is a null statement in Python that does not perform any meaningful work.
- When it is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.
^1684976004826


Do string literals exist in Python? #card 
- Yes, they do.
- In Python, string literals are sequences of characters surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.
	- For example `'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.
^1684976004831


Can you concatenate a string literal with a string in Python? #card 
Yes, you can.
^1684976004835


Does Python have a specific `char` data type like other programming languages?
- No, unlike other programming languages, Python does not have a specific `char` datatype like some other programming languages.
- Instead, a single character is simple a string with a length of 1.

##### Approach

##### Solution

```python
def greet(s):

##### Problem

Generally, how many types of programming languages are there? #card 
There are two types‚Ä¶
- compiled
- interpreted
^1684976004838


What is an example of a **compiled** programming language? #card 
- C++
- C
- Haskell
^1684976004842


What is an example of a **interpreted** programming language? #card 
- Python
- PHP
^1684976004847


IsJavaScript a **compiled** or **interpreted** language? #card 
- Neither.JavaScript defies classification because at a very technical level it is compiled before being interpreted by the browser line by line.
- Some still classifyJavaScript as an interpreted language‚Ä¶
	- For instance, an article from Stanford states thatJavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over theJavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More *modern* browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compilesJavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
^1684976004851


What isJavaScript‚Äôs syntax heavily inspired by? #card 
- JavaScript‚Äôs syntax is heavily inspired byC++ and Java.
^1684976004856


What areJavaScript‚Äôs inner workings inspired by? #card 
- The inner workings ofJavaScript is closer to a dynamically-typed interpreted language such asPython or Ruby.
^1684976004860


What does JIT stand for? #card
It is the abbreviation for Just-In-Time compilation.
^1684976004864


What is JIT compilation? #card-reverse 
A technology which compilesJavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
^1684976004868


What is ECMAScript? #card 
A JavaScript standard to ensure the interoperability of webpages across different browsers.
^1684976004872


What is the definition of interoperability? #card 
Interoperability is a characteristic of a product or system to work with other products or systems.
^1684976004877


What are some types of interoperability? #card-reverse  
- <span class="spoiler">**syntactic interoperability**</span>: Where two systems can communicate with each other
- <span class="spoiler">**cross-domain interoperability**</span>: where multiple organizations work together and exchange information
^1684976004881


What does ECMA stand for? #card-reverse 
European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) International
^1684976004886


What does `=>` mean in ECMAScript?
- Part of the arrow function syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
- Its a shorthand way to define a function expression. 
	- For example, the code below defines a function named `greet` that takes one argument `s`.
```jsx {nums}
const greet = (s) => { ... } 
```

What is the difference between `let` and `var` in JavaScript? #card-reverse 
- <span class="spoiler">`let`</span> is is block-scoped meaning that a variable declared with it is in only accessible within the entire function.
- <span class="spoiler">`var`</span> is function-scoped, meaning that a variable declared with it is accessible within the entire function in which it is declared.

How many module systems does Node.js have? #card 
Two
^1684976004895


What are the module systems that Node.js has? #card-reverse 
- CommonJS
- ECMAScript
^1684976004899


Is it true, that by default, Node.js will practically always default to using the CommonJS module system. #card 
True.
^1684976004903


Calling what keywords in Node.js uses what Node.js module system? #card 
- Calling `require()` always uses the CommonJS module loader.
- Calling `import()` always uses the ECMAScript module loader.
^1684976004906


What is CommonJS? #card-reverse 
A project with the goal to establish conventions on the module ecosystem forJavaScript *outside* of the web browser.
^1684976004911

![[ü§ñ ChatGPT, Bing Chat, etc. Warning]]

**Front**: What is the `module` keyword in Node.js?
**Back**: The `module` keyword is an object representing the current module or file in the CommonJS module system used in Node.js for handling modularization.

**Front**: What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js?
**Back**: `module.exports` is a property of the `module` object used to export functions, objects, or variables from the current module, making them accessible to other modules.

**Front**: How is the `greet` function exported in the givenJavaScript code?
**Back**: The `greet` function is exported by adding it to an object and assigning the object to `module.exports`.

DoesJavaScript have primitive data types? #card 
Yes,JavaScript has a few primitive data types.
^1684976004919


What is a primitive data type in the context ofJavaScript? #card 
A primitive type is a basic data type that is not an object and has no methods. 
^1684976004922


What are some ofJavaScript‚Äôs primitive data types?
JavaScript's primitive types include:
1.  String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as `"Hello, world!"`.
2.  Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., `42` or `3.14`.
3.  BigInt: Represents integers of arbitrary length, e.g., `9007199254740991n`.
4.  Boolean: Represents a true or false value, e.g., `true` or `false`.
5.  Null: Represents a value that intentionally has no value or reference, e.g., `null`.
6.  Undefined: Represents a value that has not been assigned, e.g., `undefined`.
7.  Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, typically used as object property keys, e.g., `Symbol('description')`.

Are primitive types inJavaScript objects? #card 
While primitive types are not objects and don't have methods themselves,JavaScript automatically wraps them in corresponding object wrappers when you try to access their methods, allowing you to use methods like `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`.
^1684976004927


What does `prototype` mean in the method `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`? #card 
InJavaScript, <span class="spoiler">`prototype`</span> is a property of a constructor function that is used to define shared properties and methods for all instances created using that constructor.
^1684976004932


How doesJavaScript implement inheritance? #card-reverse 
-JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it uses a prototypical inheritance.
- This is instead of classical inheritance as seen in languages like Java orC++
^1684976004936


What happens when an object is created inJavaScript? #card 
- When an object is created inJavaScript, it gets an internal reference to its "prototype" object. 
	- This prototype object is used to look up properties and methods that are not directly defined on the object itself. 
	- If a requested property or method is not found on the object,JavaScript will search the prototype chain, which is a series of connected prototype objects, until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (which is `null`).
- For example, when you create an array inJavaScript, it is an instance of the `Array` constructor:
```jsx
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
```
- This array instance has access to methods like `push`, `pop`, and `slice`. 
- These methods are not defined directly on the `arr` object but are instead defined on the `Array.prototype` object. 
	- When you call a method on `arr`,JavaScript looks up the method in the prototype chain, ultimately finding it on `Array.prototype`.
^1684976004940


Is using prototypes efficient? #card-reverse 
- Using <span class="spoiler">prototypes</span> allows for more efficient memory usage.
- This is because shared <span class="spoiler">properties</span> and methods are defined only once on the <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>, rather than on each instance of the object.
- This also makes it easy to extend or modify the behavior of all instances of a constructor, by simply modifying the constructor‚Äôs <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>.
^1684976004944



##### Approach

##### Solution

```jsx
const greet = (s) => {
  // todo

#### C++

##### Problem

In C++, how can you represent negative or positive infinity? #card 
- One can use the <span class="spoiler">`limits`</span> library, which is part of theC++ Standard library.
- With that, you can use the function `numeric_limits<int>ÍûâÍûâinfinity()` to call postive infinity of the type `int`. 
- If you wanted to negative infinity, you can simply do `-numeric_limits<int>ÍûâÍûâinfinity()` to call negative infinity of the type `int`. 
^1684976004949

When trying to assign the value *negative* infinity (of type `int`) via the `<limits>` library, where should one place the negative sign? #card 
`-numeric_limits<int>ÍûâÍûâinfinity()` Note that the negative sign is placed *before* the whole expression.
^1684976004952

What does the `ÍûâÍûâ` mean in the expression `numeric_limits<int>ÍûâÍûâinfinity()`? #card 
- In C++ programming language, the¬†`::`¬†is called the¬†**scope resolution operator**. ^1684976004956
- It is used to specify the scope of a function or variable. 
	- In this case,¬†`numeric_limits<int>::infinity()`¬†means that the¬†`infinity()`¬†function is being called from the¬†`numeric_limits`¬†class template specialized for the¬†`int`¬†type. ^1684976004961
^1684976004965

In C++, what is the difference between iterator based loops vs range-`for` loop? #card-reverse 
- First and foremost, use range-`for` loops.
- A range-`for` loop uses iterators internally. The loop variable is the *dereferenced value*, not the iterator itself.
^1684976004969

In C++, does a range-`for` loop expose access to its internal iterators? #card 
A range-`for` loop does *not* expose access to its internal iterators.
^1684976004973


What are **containers** in C++? #card 
- In C++, containers are data structures that store and organize a collection of objects in memory.
- They are parts of the C++ Standard Library and provide a convenient way to manage collections of data, offering different trade-offs in terms of‚Ä¶
	- performance
	- memory usage
	- functionality
^1684976004977


What are the main categories of containers in C++? #card-reverse  
	- Sequence containers
	- Associative containers
^1684976004982


What are sequence containers? #card-reverse  
- Store elements in a linear sequence, where each element has a specific position.
- Examples include‚Ä¶
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâvector`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A dynamic array that automatically resizes itself whenits capacity is exceeded. It provides fast random access and efficient insertions/deletion at the end, but inertions/deletions in the middle can be slow.</span> 
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâlist`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A doubly-linked list that allows for fast insertinos and deletions at any position, but does not support random access.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâdeque`:</span> <span class="spoiler">A double-ended queue that supports fast random access and efficient insertions/deletions at both the beginning and the end.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâforward_list` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A singly-linked list that allows for fast insertions and deletions at any position, but does not support random access or bidirectional traversal.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâarray` (sineC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A fixed-size array with a compile-time size, providing fast random access and a small memory footprint.</span>
^1684976004986


What are associative containers? #card-reverse  
- These containers store elements in a sorted or hashed manner, which allows for faster access, insertion, and deletion based on specific keys.
- Examples include‚Ä¶
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâset`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of unique elements, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâmultiset`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `stdÍûâÍûâset`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâmap`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of key-value pairs, with unique keys, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâmultimap`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `stdÍûâÍûâmap`, but allows multiple key-value pairs with the same key.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâunordered_set` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A hashed collection of unique elements, providing average constant-time access, insertion, and deletion.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâunordered_multiset` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `stdÍûâÍûâunordered_set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâunordered_map` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">A hashed collection of key-value pairs, with unique keys, providing average constant-time access, insertion, and deletion.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`stdÍûâÍûâunordered_multimap` (sinceC++11)</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `stdÍûâÍûâunordered_map`, but allows multiple key-value pairs with the same key.</span>
^1684976004989


What are some key benefits of containers inC++? #card-reverse

	- <span class="spoiler">transforming elements</span>
^1684976004994


In C++, what is an input iterator? #card-reverse 
- A type of iterator that allows you to traverse a container in a read-only, forward direction.
	- It is the most basic iterator category in theC++ Standard Library
	- Provides the minimum functionality required for single-pass algorithms, like reading elements from an input stream, or iterating through elements of a container in a linear fashion.

##### Problem

What is a prime number? #card-reverse 
- A¬†<span class="spoiler">**prime number**</span>¬†(or a¬†<span class="spoiler">**prime**</span>) is a¬†[natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number")¬†greater than 1 that is not a¬†[product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)")¬†of two smaller natural numbers.
- A natural number greater than 1 that is not <span class="spoiler">prime</span> is called a¬†[composite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number "Composite number").
^1684976005024

##### Approach

What is the most optimal approach to solving this problem? #card 
- Iterate from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ to iterate through all potential divisors of the number $n$ that could be a factor proving that $n$ is not a prime number 
- To better visualize, take a look at this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/geometry-beta/2zvelza7ht).
^1687576716586

If one divisor of a number is a factor, does that mean its corresponding divisor is a factor also? #card 
- Yes, that's correct. If a number 'b' is a divisor of a number 'a', then 'b' is a factor of 'a'. Similarly, the corresponding quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' is also a factor of 'a'.
- For example, consider the number 12. The divisors (or factors) of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. When you divide 12 by 2, you get 6. Here, both 2 and 6 are divisors of 12. Similarly, dividing 12 by 3 gives 4. Both 3 and 4 are also divisors (factors) of 12.
- In general, for any number 'a', if it can be expressed as a product 'b * c', then both 'b' and 'c' are factors (divisors) of 'a'.

How do I compute the square root of a number in C++? #card 
- Include the `<cmath>` library to call the `std::sqrt()` function. ^1687576716592

Does C++ have a built-in function to check if a number is prime? #card 
No, currently it does not have one.
^1687576716599

So always use the  `<cx>` headers if you are writing C++? #card 
Yes. For example, default to using the `<cmath>` header instead of the `<math.h>`

What is something I *always* make a mistake on when solving this problem and **have** to remember when approaching this problem? #card 
Must make sure when I looping all potential factors. I set the bounds of that loop from $2$ to *inclusive* $\sqrt{n}$.
