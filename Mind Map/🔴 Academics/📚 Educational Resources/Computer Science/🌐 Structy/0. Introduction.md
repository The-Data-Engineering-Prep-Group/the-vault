What is a **string literal** in C++?
 #card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Also, known as an **anonymous string**, is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code.
- Is essentially text between double quotes
	- For example: `"Hey World"`
^1684976004801


Should I use `strcat()`?
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
- No, strcat() is considered unsafe. 
- This is because there is nothing to stop you from `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence buffer, with undefined results up to and including…
	- heap corruption
	- stack corruption
	- program exit
	- even somebody owning your machine if the data past the 100th byte is appropriately constructed.
		- This is a common class of security vulnerability called a buffer overflow
- To avoid this, use `std꞉꞉string`’s operator+ 
^1684976004805


What is a **buffer overflow**?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
When you input more data that the buffer allows. For example, consider `strcat()`-ing more than 100 bytes into your sentence. As a result, the remaining input data *“overflows”* to the rest of your memory.
^1684976004809

What do you notice about the below code?
```cpp
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "Hello");
    strcat(buffer, ", World!"); // buffer overflow here
    std꞉꞉cout << buffer << std꞉꞉endl;
    return 0;
}
```
 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
In this example, `buffer` is an array of 10 characters, but we’re trying to concatenate a string of 13 characters into it using `strcat()`. This causes a buffer overflow because `strcat()` doesn’t check the size of the destination buffer and writes past the end of it.
^1684976004814

What is the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- `strcpy()` and `strcat()` are both functions used to manipulate strings in C and C++. They are both defined in the `string.h` header file.
- `strcpy()` is used to copy a string from one location to another. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the copied string will be stored, and a source string that will be copied. The function copies the entire source string (including the null character) to the destination buffer.
- `strcat()` is used to concatenate two strings. It takes two arguments: a destination buffer where the concatenated string will be stored, and a source string that will be appended to the end of the destination string. The function appends the entire source string (including the null character) to the end of the destination string.
- Here’s an example that demonstrates the difference between `strcpy()` and `strcat()`:
```c++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    char str1[20] = "Hello";
    char str2[20] = ", World!";
    char str3[20];
    strcpy(str3, str1); // str3 now contains "Hello"
    strcat(str3, str2); // str3 now contains "Hello, World!"
    std꞉꞉cout << str3 << std꞉꞉endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- In this example, `str1` is an array of characters initialized with the string `"Hello"`, and `str2` is an array of characters initialized with the string `", World!"`. `str3` is an array of 20 characters. The first call to `strcpy()` copies the contents of `str1` into `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello"`. The call to `strcat()` appends the contents of `str2` to the end of `str3`, so `str3` now contains `"Hello, World!"`.
^1684976004818

Do I need to declare another variable for this problem?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, can simply return the necessary value as follows…
`return "hey " + str`
^1684976004822


What is the optimal solution to this program?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
#include <string>
std::string greet(std꞉꞉string s) {
  // todo
  return "hey " + s;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```

#### Solution (Python)

What is the `pass` keyword in Python?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/python
- <span class="spoiler">`pass`</span> is a null statement in that does not perform any meaningful work.
- When it is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed.
^1684976004826


Do string literals exist in Python?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/python
- Yes, they do.
- In Python, string literals are sequences of characters surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.
	- For example `'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.
^1684976004831


Can you concatenate a string literal with a string in Python?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/python
Yes, you can.
^1684976004835


Does have a specific `char` data type like other programming languages?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/python
- No, unlike other programming languages, (Python)does not have a specific `char` datatype like some other programming languages.
- Instead, a single character is simple a string with a length of 1.

#### Solution (JavaScript)

Generally, how many types of programming languages are there?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
There are two types…
- compiled
- interpreted
^1684976004838


What is an example of a **compiled** programming language?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- C++
- C
- Haskell
^1684976004842


What is an example of a **interpreted** programming language?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- Python
- PHP
^1684976004847


IsJavaScript a **compiled** or **interpreted** language?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- Neither.JavaScript defies classification because at a very technical level it is compiled before being interpreted by the browser line by line.
- Some still classifyJavaScript as an interpreted language…
	- For instance, an article from Stanford states thatJavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over theJavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. More *modern* browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compilesJavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
^1684976004851


What is JavaScript’s syntax heavily inspired by?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- JavaScript’s syntax is heavily inspired by C++ and Java.
^1684976004856


What are JavaScript’s inner workings inspired by?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- The inner workings of JavaScript is closer to a dynamically-typed interpreted language such asPython or Ruby.
^1684976004860


What does JIT stand for?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
It is the abbreviation for Just-In-Time compilation.
^1684976004864


What is JIT compilation?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
A technology which compilesJavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.
^1684976004868


What is ECMAScript?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
A JavaScript standard to ensure the interoperability of webpages across different browsers.
^1684976004872


What is the definition of interoperability?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
Interoperability is a characteristic of a product or system to work with other products or systems.
^1684976004877


What are some types of interoperability?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript 
- <span class="spoiler">**syntactic interoperability**</span>: Where two systems can communicate with each other
- <span class="spoiler">**cross-domain interoperability**</span>: where multiple organizations work together and exchange information
^1684976004881


What does ECMA stand for?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) International
^1684976004886


What does `=>` mean in ECMAScript?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- Part of the arrow function syntax introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
- Its a shorthand way to define a function expression. 
	- For example, the code below defines a function named `greet` that takes one argument `s`.
```jsx {nums}
const greet = (s) => { ... } 
```
^1690054146686

What is the difference between `let` and `var` in JavaScript?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- <span class="spoiler">`let`</span> is is block-scoped meaning that a variable declared with it is in only accessible within the entire global, local (ie., function), or block scope.
- <span class="spoiler">`var`</span>…
	- Has no block scope
	- Tolerates redeclarations
	- Can be declared before their use
^1684976004890

What is the scope of `const`?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
Follows the same scope rules as `let`
^1691048038269

How many module systems does Node.js have?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
Two
^1684976004895


What are the module systems that Node.js has?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- CommonJS
- ECMAScript
^1684976004899


Is it true, that by default, Node.js will practically always default to using the CommonJS module system.  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
True.
^1684976004903


Calling what keywords in Node.js uses what Node.js module system?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- Calling `require()` always uses the CommonJS module loader.
- Calling `import()` always uses the ECMAScript module loader.
^1684976004906


What is CommonJS?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
A project with the goal to establish conventions on the module ecosystem forJavaScript *outside* of the web browser.
^1684976004911


Can you concatenate a literal string and a variable of type string inJavaScript by using the addition operator (+)?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
Yes.
^1684976004915

**Front**: What is the `module` keyword in Node.js? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
**Back**: The `module` keyword is an object representing the current module or file in the CommonJS module system used in Node.js for handling modularization.
^1691135076117

**Front**: What is the purpose of `module.exports` in Node.js? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
**Back**: `module.exports` is a property of the `module` object used to export functions, objects, or variables from the current module, making them accessible to other modules.
^1691135076122

**Front**: How is the `greet` function exported in the given JavaScript code? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
**Back**: The `greet` function is exported by adding it to an object and assigning the object to `module.exports`.
^1691135076126

Does JavaScript have primitive data types?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
Yes, JavaScript has a few primitive data types.
^1684976004919


What is a primitive data type in the context of JavaScript?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
A primitive type is a basic data type that is not an object and has no methods. 
^1684976004922


What are some of JavaScript’s primitive data types? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript 
JavaScript's primitive types include:
1.  `String`: Represents a sequence of characters, such as `"Hello, world!"`.
2.  `Number`: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers, e.g., `42` or `3.14`.
3.  `BigInt`: Represents integers of arbitrary length, e.g., `9007199254740991n`.
4.  `Boolean`: Represents a true or false value, e.g., `true` or `false`.
5.  `Null`: Represents a value that intentionally has no value or reference, e.g., `null`.
6.  `Undefined`: Represents a value that has not been assigned, e.g., `undefined`.
7.  `Symbol`: Represents a unique and immutable value, typically used as object property keys, e.g., `Symbol('description')`.
^1691135076131

Are primitive types in JavaScript objects?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
While primitive types are not objects and don't have methods themselves, JavaScript automatically wraps them in corresponding object wrappers when you try to access their methods, allowing you to use methods like `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`.
^1684976004927


What does `prototype` mean in the method `String.prototype.toUpperCase` or `Number.prototype.toFixed`?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
In JavaScript, <span class="spoiler">`prototype`</span> is a property of a constructor function that is used to define shared properties and methods for all instances created using that constructor.
^1684976004932


How does JavaScript implement inheritance?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
-JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means it uses a prototypical inheritance.
- This is instead of classical inheritance as seen in languages like Java orC++
^1684976004936


What happens when an object is created in JavaScript?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- When an object is created in JavaScript, it gets an internal reference to its "prototype" object. 
	- This prototype object is used to look up properties and methods that are not directly defined on the object itself. 
	- If a requested property or method is not found on the object, JavaScript will search the prototype chain, which is a series of connected prototype objects, until it either finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (which is `null`).
- For example, when you create an array in JavaScript, it is an instance of the `Array` constructor:
```jsx
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
```
- This array instance has access to methods like `push`, `pop`, and `slice`. 
- These methods are not defined directly on the `arr` object but are instead defined on the `Array.prototype` object. 
	- When you call a method on `arr`,JavaScript looks up the method in the prototype chain, ultimately finding it on `Array.prototype`.
^1684976004940


Is using prototypes efficient?  
#card-reverse #computer-science/programming-language/javascript
- Using <span class="spoiler">prototypes</span> allows for more efficient memory usage.
- This is because shared <span class="spoiler">properties</span> and methods are defined only once on the <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>, rather than on each instance of the object.
- This also makes it easy to extend or modify the behavior of all instances of a constructor, by simply modifying the constructor’s <span class="spoiler">prototype</span>.

### 003. max-value 💻

#### Solution (C++)

In modern C++, what is the optimal solution for the following problem? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach 1** Using the `max_element()` function
	1. Just use the `max_element()`!
	- **Computational Complexity**:
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
- **Approach 2** Using pointers
	1. Create a variable called `maxValue` that will be initially set to the `numeric_limits<int>::max()`.
	2. Iterate across the container.
		1. If the current `maxValue` is less than the current value, set `maxValue` to that value.
	- **Computational Complexity**:
		- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
		- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### Attempt #1 (2023-22-07) ⏲️ 00:04:00


In C++, how can you represent negative or positive infinity? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- One can use the <span class="spoiler">`limits`</span> library, which is part of the C++ Standard library.
- With that, you can use the function `numeric_limits<int>꞉꞉infinity()` to call postive infinity of the type `int`. 
- If you wanted to negative infinity, you can simply do `-numeric_limits<int>꞉꞉infinity()` to call negative infinity of the type `int`. 
^1684976004949

What is the downside of using `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` than just using `numeric_limits<int>::double()`?
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- `std::numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` return the representation of positive, **if available**. 
- However, `std::numeric_limits<int>::has_inifinity` returns `false` for `int`, meaning that `std::numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` does not return any meaningful value to compare with.
^1690056204669

How can I check the if a data type supports infinity? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Use the `std::numeric_limits<int>::has_inifinity` to check if the value returned from that expression is `true` or `false`.
^1690056204674

When trying to assign the value *negative* infinity (of type `int`) via the `<limits>` library, where should one place the negative sign?
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
`-numeric_limits<int>꞉꞉infinity()` Note that the negative sign is placed *before* the whole expression.
^1684976004952

What does the `꞉꞉` mean in the expression `numeric_limits<int>꞉꞉infinity()`?
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- In C++ programming language, the `::` is called the **scope resolution operator**. 
- It is used to specify the scope of a function or variable. 
	- In this case, `numeric_limits<int>::infinity()` means that the `infinity()` function is being called from the `numeric_limits` class template specialized for the `int` type. 
^1684976004965

What does `numeric_limits<int>::lowest()` return when the data type is of `int`?
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Returns the lowest  possible (negative) value of `int`
- Same as `numeric_limits<int>::min()`
^1690056204678


What does `numeric_limits<int>::min()` return when the data type is of `int`?
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Returns the lowest  possible (negative) value of `int`
- Same as `numeric_limits<int>::lowest()`
^1690056204683

What does `numerc_limits<int>::min()` return when the data type is of a floating-point type (i.e., `double`, `float`)? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Return the minimum positive normalized value.
- Note, how this is different from when the data type is `int`.
^1690056204688


What does `numerc_limits<int>::min()` return when the data type is of a floating-point type?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Return the lowest value (which can be negative) of the type.
^1690056204693


What can `double` and `float` be classified as?  
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
 They can be classified as **floating point** data points.
^1690056227110


In C++, what is the difference between iterator based loops vs range-`for` loop?  
#card-reverse  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- First and foremost, use range-`for` loops.
- A range-`for` loop uses iterators internally. The loop variable is the *dereferenced value*, not the iterator itself.
^1684976004969


In C++, does a range-`for` loop expose access to its internal iterators?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
A range-`for` loop does *not* expose access to its internal iterators.
^1684976004973


What are **containers** in C++?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- In C++, containers are data structures that store and organize a collection of objects in memory.
- They are parts of the C++ Standard Library and provide a convenient way to manage collections of data, offering different trade-offs in terms of…
	- performance
	- memory usage

^1684976004986


What are associative and unordered associative containers?  
#card-reverse  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
- These containers store elements in a sorted or hashed manner, which allows for faster access, insertion, and deletion based on specific keys.
- Examples include…
	- <span class="spoiler">`std꞉꞉set`</span>: <span class="spoiler">A sorted collection of unique elements, typically implemented as a balanced binary search tree.</span>
	- <span class="spoiler">`std꞉꞉multiset`</span>: <span class="spoiler">Similar to `std꞉꞉set`, but allows multiple instances of the same element.</span>

First and foremost, what exactly is an `input_iterator`?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- To provide more context, an input iterator is a type of iterator that is part of a collection/new way of organizing iterators called “[Iterator concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator).”
	- While, I am still unsure about what the difference is between an `input_iterator` and a `output_iterator`, we need not concern ourselves for now.

What are three types of forms of ranged-based `for` loops using the keyword `auto`?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
// The auto keyword causes type inference to be used. Preferred. 
for( auto y : x ) { // Copy of 'x', almost always undesirable 
	cout << y << " ";
} 
cout << endl;
for( auto &y : x ) { // Type inference by reference.
	// Observes and/or modifies in-place. Preferred when modify is needed. 
	cout << y << " ";
} 
cout << endl; 
for( const auto &y : x ) { // Type inference by const reference.
	// Observes in-place. Preferred when no modify is needed.
	cout << y << " ";

What is the optimal solution for this problem?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach:**
	1. Remember that an initial base case is that 0, 1, and all negative numbers are *not* prime numbers.
	2. For the general case, iterate from 2 to $\lfloor{\sqrt{ n }}\rfloor$
		1. If `i` is a whole factor, then we know that $n$ is not a prime number.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- **Time:** $O(\sqrt{n})$
	- **Space:** $O(1)$

What is a prime number?  
#card-reverse  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- A <span class="spoiler">**prime number**</span> (or a <span class="spoiler">**prime**</span>) is a [natural number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number "Natural number") greater than 1 that is not a [product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics) "Product (mathematics)") of two smaller natural numbers.
- A natural number greater than 1 that is not <span class="spoiler">prime</span> is called a [composite number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number "Composite number").

What is the most optimal approach to solving this problem?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Iterate from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ to iterate through all potential divisors of the number $n$ that could be a factor proving that $n$ is not a prime number 
- To better visualize, take a look at this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/geometry-beta/2zvelza7ht).

If one divisor of a number is a factor, does that mean its corresponding divisor is a factor also?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Yes, that's correct. If a number 'b' is a divisor of a number 'a', then 'b' is a factor of 'a'. Similarly, the corresponding quotient of 'a' divided by 'b' is also a factor of 'a'.
- For example, consider the number 12. The divisors (or factors) of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. When you divide 12 by 2, you get 6. Here, both 2 and 6 are divisors of 12. Similarly, dividing 12 by 3 gives 4. Both 3 and 4 are also divisors (factors) of 12.
- In general, for any number 'a', if it can be expressed as a product 'b * c', then both 'b' and 'c' are factors (divisors) of 'a'.
