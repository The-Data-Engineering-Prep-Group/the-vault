## 2. Linked List

### 017. linked list welcome

### 018. inked list intro

What is happens under the hood when wishing to insert the element `2` at position 2 in the array `[1,2,3,4,5]`? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
The array first has to shift all the elements from position 2 to the end right by 1. Then it can insert `2` into the new empty cell of the array at position 2.
^1690931237697

What is the worst-case time complexity of insertion for an array? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
^1690931237711

What is the worst-case time complexity of insertion for a linked list? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Time complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$
^1690931237720

Do you need all the nodes to traverse a linked list? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, just the head node.
^1690931237726

### 019. linked list warm up

What is an iterative solution for traversing and printing out all values of a linked list? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
void printLinkedList(Node* head) {
	Node* currNode = head;
	while(currNode != nullptr) {
		std::cout << currNode->value << " -> " << std::endl;
		currNode = currNode->next;
	}
}
```
^1690931237732

What is the recursive solution for traversing and printing out all the values of a linked list? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
```cpp
void printLinkedList(Node* currNode) {
	// Base Case
	if (currNode == nullptr) {
		// nothing happens
	}
	else {
		print(head->value);
		printLinkedList(head->next); 
	}
}
```
^1690931237737

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
void printLinkedList(Node* currNode) {
	print(head->value);
	printLinkedList(head->next); 
}
```
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- While the code will compile, there is a runtime error in the fact that the node recursive function will eventually call a node pointing to `nullptr`
	- At that point, we will get a runtime error stating that we have are trying to access a `nullptr`.
^1690931237742

What must you always remember to type out, or consider, **first** in a recursive function?  
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
The base cases.

### 020. linked list values

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal** solution to this problem? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the iterative approach.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
‚ö†Ô∏è Below not optimal, for review purposes only‚Ä¶
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the recursive approach and make sure to have your recursive function be formatted correctly.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
^1690931237753

##### Attempt #1 (2023-01-08) ‚è≤Ô∏è 00:06:20

Do in-place operations on Node value happen at the start or end of the linked list? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
Depends on if the operation happens **before** *or* **after** the recursive call‚Ä¶
- Before: We start at the front of the linked list.
- End: We start at the end of the linked list.
^1690931926036

##### Attempt #2 (2023-01-08) ‚è≤Ô∏è 00:07:00 

Is the optimal approach to these types of linked list problems iterative _or_ recursive? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
The optimal solution to these types of problems is iterative.
^1690931926042

### 021. sum list

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal** solution to this problem? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach:** 
	1. Declare an `int` that will serve as our running total holder.
	2. Then simply iterate across the linked list and add each node‚Äôs value to the running total holder.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
‚ö†Ô∏è Below not optimal, for review purposes only‚Ä¶
- **Approach:** 
	1. Simply do the recursive approach and make sure to have your recursive function be formatted correctly.
	2. Your recursive function does not need to have another argument for the sum, can just return the running sum.
- **Asymptotic Analysis:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
^1690931237753

##### Attempt #1 (2023-01-08) ‚è≤Ô∏è 00:07:00

What is the basic structure of a recursive function? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
1. Base case
2. `else-if` and `else` statements for all other conditions
	1. Call the the recursive functions first
	2. Then work ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù from the end and return the value at that point to the earlier stack.
^1690931237757

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node(int initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
int recursiveSumList(Node* head, int sum) {
  if (head == nullptr) {
    sum += 0;
    return sum;
  }
  else {
    int prevSum = recursiveSumList(head->next, sum);
    sum += head->val + prevSum;
    return sum;
  }
}
int sumList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  int sum {0};
  sum = recursiveSumList(head, sum);
 
  return sum;
}
```
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Yes, but it is **not** optimal. Beside it being the recursive approach‚Ä¶
	- You do **not** need the parameter `sum` for your recursive function. You can simply ‚Äúbuild‚Äù the sum values by returning them and then adding them to the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù stack‚Äôs node value as we move back up the linked list.
- Example of optimized code...
```cpp
class Node {
  public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node(int initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
int recurisveSumList(Node* node) {
  if(node == nullptr) {
    return 0;
  }
  else {
    return recurisveSumList(node->next) + node->val;
  }
}
int sumList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  int sum = recurisveSumList(head);
  return sum;
}
```
Remember that the optimal approach is to traverse the linked list iteratively.
^1690931237762


What is the naming of helper function in C++? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
There is really no set naming convention, but you should just prefix all helper functions with an underscore (i.e., ‚Äò\_‚Äô).
^1690931237767


What is the difference between **helper functions** and utility functions? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Helper functions** 
	- Can be instantiated.
	- Can have instance variables and also have both instance and static methods, while utility functions only have static variables and methods.
- **Utility functions**
	- Cannot be instantiated because they have a private constructor. 
	- Utility functions often have a global scope within an application, while helper functions are always given a package scope.
^1690931237771

Why is should we always attempt to go with the **iterative** approach first _instead_ of the **recursive** approach? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- Iterative approaches to linked list problems are generally preferred over recursive approaches because they have a lower space complexity.
- This is because recursive approaches require the use of the call tack, which can grow quite large for long linked lists.
^1690931926047





### 022. linked list find

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for the problem? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
- **Approach:**
	- Simply use the `head` node and iterate through the list until we reach a `nullptr`.
		- If the current node‚Äôs `val` equals the `target`, return true
	- If we reach end, then just return `false`.
- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$
^1691040717784

##### Attempt #1 (2023-02-8) ‚è≤Ô∏è00:07:00

Hypothetically, what if the linked list was a cycle? Could we simply iterate by having a `while()` loop where the iteration continues till the current node equals `nullptr`? 
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
No, this would not works. It would essentially be runtime error, cause we would be looping infinitely.
- Would need some mnemonic data structure to alert us when we come across the same node again!
- Best to just use a `set` in this case. 
^1691040717789

### 023. get node value

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for the problem? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
 - **Approach:**
	1. For ease, have a separate variable to be the incrementor. I.e., we will use this to increment *to* the `idx`.
	2. While our incrementor does not equal `idx`
		1. Check our **edge case** and make sure the node is not a `nullptr`.
			1. If it is, return an empty string
		2. If we are at the `idx` position
			1. Return the value.
		3. Increment to the next Node
		4. Increment our incrementor
- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

### 024. reverse list

#### Solution (C++)

What is the **optimal solution** for the problem? 
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
 - **Approach:** 
	1. First consider the following base cases‚Ä¶
		1. Consider the case where `head` is a `nullptr`; just return `nullptr`
		2. Consider the case where the linked list is of length 1; just return `head`;
	2. Now the general case‚Ä¶
		1. Create and set `dummy` to `nullptr` (the position *before* the beginning)
		2. Create and set `next_node` to `head->next` (the position *after* the beginning)
		3. Now iterate while `head` does not equal `nullptr`‚Ä¶
			1. Set `head->next` to equal `dummy`
			2. Set `dummy` equal to `head`
			3. Set `head` to equal `next_node`
			4. Set `next_node` equal to `head->next`
			5. If `next_node` is equal to `nullptr` (it is at the end of the original list/beginning of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù reversed list)
				1. Set `head->next` to `dummy`
				2. Return `head`
- **Asymptotic Complexity:**
	- Time: $\mathcal{O}(n)$
	- Space: $\mathcal{O}(1)$

##### Attempt #1 (2023-02-8) ‚è≤Ô∏è

Is the following code valid? 
```cpp
#include <string>
class Node {
  public:
    std::string val;
    Node* next;
    Node(std::string initialVal) {
      val = initialVal;
      next = nullptr;
    }
};
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
  // todo
  // Base where list is empty
  if(head == nullptr) {
    return nullptr;
  }
  // Base case where length of list is 1 
  if(head->next = nullptr) {
    return head;
  }
  // Begin general case
  Node* ans = head;
  Node* dummy = nullptr;
  Node* next_node = head->next;
  while(head != nullptr) {
    head->next = dummy;
    dummy = head;
    head = next_node;
    next_node = head->next;
    if(next_node == nullptr) {
      break;
    }
  }
  return ans;
}
void run() {
  // this function behaves as `main()` for the 'run' command
  // you may sandbox in this function, but should not remove it
}
```
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
While the code is valid, and will compile, it is not logically sound.
- After you reverse a linked list, you will already be at the end of the original list (i.e., start of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù reversed list). By returning `ans`, you are just returning the *end* of your ‚Äúnew‚Äù reversed linked list.
- Also, you are setting the `head` to point to `nullptr` in the base case where length of list is 1. **Make sure to *never* use assignment operators when dealing with expression for conditional checks!!!**
^1691045339947

Is the following code valid?
```cpp
#include <string>
class Node {
public:
    std::string val;
    Node* next;
    Node(std::string initialVal) {
        val = initialVal;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};
Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
    // todo
    // Base where list is empty
    if(head == nullptr) {
        return nullptr;
    }
    // Base case where length of list is 1
    if(head->next == nullptr) {
        return head;
    }
    // Begin general case
    Node* dummy = nullptr;
    Node* next_node = head->next;
    while(head != nullptr) {
        head->next = dummy;
        dummy = head;
        head = next_node;
        next_node = head->next;
        if(next_node == nullptr) {
            break;
        }
    }
    return head;
}
```
#card  #computer-science/programming-language/cpp
While the following code is valid, it is not logically correct.
- When `next_node` arrives at the end of the linked list (i.e., `next_node` is equal to `nullptr`), we need to remember to set `head`‚Äôs `next` values to equal to `dummy`.

Yes the following code is **valid** and logically correct. 
^1691045339958

When doing the in-place three pointer approach, are these the correct steps for the general case?
#card #computer-science/programming-language/cpp 
1. Now the general case‚Ä¶
	1. Create and set `dummy` to `nullptr` (the position *before* the beginning)
	2. Create and set `next_node` to `head->next` (the position *after* the beginning)
	3. Now iterate while `head` does not equal `nullptr`‚Ä¶
		1. Set `head->next` to equal `dummy`
		3. Set `head` to equal `next_node`
		4. Set `next_node` equal to `head->next`
		5. If `next_node` is equal to `nullptr` (it is at the end of the original list/beginning of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù reversed list)
			2. Return `head`
- No! We forget to set `dummy` equal to `head` *right after* changing where `head->next` points too.
- We also forgot to consider changing `head->next` to `dummy` when we `next_node` is equal to `nullptr`.
