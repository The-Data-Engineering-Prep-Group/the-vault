What does **burying** a card do? #card 
- Doing this hides the card from review until the next day.
- This is useful if you want to temporarily not see a card while reviewing but don’t want to suspend it or permanently delete it.

What does **suspending** a card do? #card 
- Doing this removes it from review until you manually unsuspend it later.
- This is helpful if you don’t need to review a card anymore and want to focus on other cards you are still learning but you don’t want to delete it.
