What is important to remember when renaming branches locally? #card-reverse 
- Note that renaming a branch only affects your local repository.
- If you have already pushed the branch to a remote repository, you will need to update the remote repository as well. You can do this by deleting the old branch from the remote repository and pushing the new branch:
```bash
# Delete the old branch from the remote repository
git push origin --delete old-name
# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push origin new-name
```

Does renaming an existing remote, also rename the repository name on the hosting provider? (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)? #card 
No, the `git remote rename` command only renames the remote in your local repository. It does not change the name of the repository on GitHub or any other remote hosting service. If you want to rename your repository on GitHub, you can do so through the repository settings on the GitHub website.

[What command to see all the branches of a remote repository?](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-remote.html) #card-reverse

What is the opposite of git add? #card-reverse 
The opposite of¬†`git add`¬†is¬†`git reset`. The¬†`git add`¬†command stages changes to be committed, while the¬†`git reset`¬†command unstages changes. Here‚Äôs an example:
```bash
# Stage changes to file.txt
git add file.txt
# Unstage changes to file.txt
git reset file.txt
```
This will unstage the changes to¬†`file.txt`¬†that were previously staged using¬†`git add`. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

What is the difference between¬†`fetch`¬†and¬†`pull`? #card-reverse  
<span class="spoiler">`Fetch`</span>¬†and¬†<span class="spoiler">`pull`</span>¬†are both used to download new data from a remote repository.¬†<span class="spoiler">`Fetch`</span>¬†only downloads new data from a remote repository but it doesn‚Äôt integrate any of this new data into your working files.¬†<span class="spoiler">`Pull`</span>, on the other hand, not only downloads new data but also directly integrates it into your current working copy files.
^1684392558511

Front: What does it mean to integrate new data into your working files? #card-reverse 
Back: By ‚Äúintegrate,‚Äù it means that¬†<span class="spoiler">`pull`</span>¬†not only downloads new data from the remote repository but also merges it with your local branch. This means that any changes made in the remote repository are applied to your local repository, updating your current working copy files with the latest changes from the remote repository.
^1684392558516

What does **unversioned files** mean? #card-reverse 
Files that have been added to the project directory but are not tracked by any VCS system.
^1684392558521

What does `git fetch` do? #card-reverse  
This command will download all the latest changes form the remote repository.
^1689813728678

How can I create a new local branch that tracks a remote branch? #card-reverse 
```bash

```
^1689813728686

So I just cloned a repo, and I having a weird issue. Right now, I am working on brnach `A`, However, I have a branch on my origin called `B`. For some reason, when I call `git fetch`, and then run `git branch -l`, the branch `B` is not being shown as a branch in the list. Only the branch `A` is being shown. What gives? #card 
- The `git branch` command, without any parameters, only shows your local branches. [When you fetch, information about your remote branches is updated, but it will only be shown when you use `git branch -r` (only remote branches) or `git branch -a` (all remote and local branches)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to see the remote branch `B` after fetching it, you can use the command `git branch -a`. [This will show you a list of all local and remote branches, including the remote branch `B`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout)[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).
- If you want to checkout the remote branch `B`, you can use the command `git checkout B`. This will create a new local branch called `B` that tracks the remote branch `B`. After checking out the remote branch, you should be able to see it when running the `git branch` command[1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46597915/git-branches-not-showing-in-git-branch-after-pull-or-fetch-but-git-checkout).

What does `git saubmodule add` do? #card 
1. **Clones the Submodule:** Starts by cloning the repository provided via a URL into the path specified in your current repository
2. **Stages the Changes:** Stages the new submodule.
3. **Commits the Changes:** The changes can be committed as usual with `git commit`.
When other clone or pull your repository, they need to use the `--recursive` flag to ensure that the submodules are properly initialized‚Ä¶
```bash
git clone --recursive [URL-to-your-repository]
```
Submodules are not automatically updated, nor do they track the origin. As such, if the remote repositroy is updated, you won‚Äôt automatically get those changes in your repository; you need to to manually update the submodule to point to a newer commit.
^1690890143387

What must I be aware if use the `submodule` command to add a repository to my repository? #card
