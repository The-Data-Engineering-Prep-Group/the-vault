What is a cloze card in Anki? #card 
A cloze card in Anki is a digital flashcard format that helps speed up your review time. It works like the fill-in-the-gap sentences from your elementary school homework. You‚Äôre presented with a sentence, you just have to recall the missing fact or concept. It is just a way of formatting your digital cards in Anki to blank out an important piece of information. This blank then becomes the key part of your recall. The information around it helps you conceptualize (or guide) you to the answer.
